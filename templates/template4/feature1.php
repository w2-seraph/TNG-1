<h1>Feature 1 Story</h1>
<p>
Your Feature 1 story goes here.  You can use HTML tags within the body of the story.  You can also use PHP code by inserting the code within a < ? php   ? > section (note that blanks were inserted in between the php starting and ending characters so the php start and end tags would display on the page.
</p>
<p>
If you are creating a story that you want to translate and display in the language the user has selected to view your site, then you can place the content that starts with the heading 1 (< h1 >) line to everything in the line before the tng_footer.php function call in your language folder and use a PHP 
</p>
include($mylanguage/feature1.php) to include the content from you language folder for each language you support on your site.
