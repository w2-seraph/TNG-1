<?php
/*Purpose of this file: To allow you to make new family or feature pages that conform to the same look-and-feel and privacy settings as the rest of your site.

NOTE: The instructions below assume you will place your new page in one of your media subfolders (for example, "histories" or "documents", or create a extrapgs subfolder to your TNG root folder) 
and use copy and paste this file to your preferred subfolder and edit the file in that subfolder.

Instructions:
STEP 1: Make a copy of this file with a different name, keeping the .php extension (for example: myfamily1.php). Make the changes described below in the copy, not the original.
STEP 2: Remove the following two lines. They are here to prevent the template from being used for malicious purposes.  */

$flags['noicons'] = false; 	// set to true to not generate the TNG menu bar 
	// set to false to generates the TNG menu bar

// for multi-language pages, you can use $text variables for your Feature Story Title

	If you use a different file name, you need to also update the family1.php file name in the include accordingly

<h1>Family 1 Story</h1>

<p>
Your Family 1 story goes here.  You can use HTML tags within the body of the story.  You can also use PHP code by inserting the code within a < ? php   ? > section (note that blanks were inserted in between the php starting and ending characters so the php start and end tags would display on the page.
</p>
<h2>Heading 2 tags</h2>
<p>Additional subheadings can be added for content</p>
<h2>Using tables</h2>
<p>You can use tables or css classes to format the layout of your page</p>
<h2>Multi-language pages</h2>
<p>
If you are creating a story that you will translate and want to display in the language the user has selected when viewing your site, then you can place the content that starts with the heading 1 (< h1 >) line to everything in the line before the tng_footer.php function call in your language folder and use a PHP 
</p>
<p>
include($mylanguage/family1.php) to include the content from you language folder for each language you support on your site.
