/*Purpose of this file: To allow you to make new family or feature pages that conform to the same look-and-feel and privacy settings as the rest of your site.

NOTE: The instructions below assume you will place your new page in one of your media subfolders (for example, "histories" or "documents", or create a extrapgs subfolder to your TNG root folder) 
and use copy and paste this file to your preferred subfolder and edit the file in that subfolder.

Instructions:
STEP 1: Make a copy of this file with a different name, keeping the .php extension (for example: mypaternal.php). Make the changes described below in the copy, not the original.
STEP 2: Remove the following two lines. They are here to prevent the template from being used for malicious purposes.  */
