		<span class="optionhead">Initial Display</span>
		<p>This option determines which pedigree format is initially displayed. When Standard is selected, all birth, marriage, and death/burial dates
		(when available) will be included in a hidden popup box. A photo of the individual is displayed if present. An image file (i.e., ArrowDown.gif) will be placed below the bottom center of the pedigree boxes wherever information
		is available, and the popup box will appear beneath the pedigree box when the Popup Event is triggered. The Compact format is
		similar to Standard, but the box size is greatly reduced, and no photos are displayed. When Box is selected,
		the standard information will appear in the pedigree boxes at all times. When Text Only is selected, a text-based version of the pedigree chart (no boxes or popup windows)
		will be shown first. The Vertical option will show the primary individual at the bottom, with the person's ancestors being displayed above them.
		The user will always have the option to switch among these display types after viewing the initial display.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Max Generations</span>
		<p>The maximum number of generations you will allow visitors to request at one time.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Initial Generations</span>
		<p>The number of generations that will be displayed to start with. If nothing is specified here, then this value will default to four.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Popup Spouses</span>
		<p>If popups are being used, checking this option will result in spouse links being included in popups.  Default is not checked.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Popup Children</span>
		<p>If popups are being used and Popup Spouses is checked, checking this option will result in children links being included in popups.  Default is not checked.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Popup Chart Links</span>
		<p>If popups are being used (and either Popup Spouses or Popup Kids has been checked), checking this option will cause links to pedigree chart pages to be included for
		spouses and children in popups.  Default is on.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Hide Empty Boxes</span>
		<p>Select 'Yes' to remove unpopulated boxes from the chart.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Box Width (w/o popups)</span>
		<p>Fixed width of all pedigree boxes (in pixels) when popup boxes are not in use. Default value is 211. If a number less than 21 is entered, 21 will
		be used. The number used will always be an odd number, so if an even number is entered, it will be increased by 1.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Box Height (w/o popups)</span>
		<p>Height of all pedigree boxes (in pixels) when popup boxes are not in use, unless a non-zero boxheightshift is specified (see below), in which case Box Height is the
		height of the first pedigree box on the chart. Default value is 121.  If a number less than 21 is entered, 21 will be used. The number used will
		always be an odd number, so if an even number is entered, it will be increased by 1.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Box Alignment (w/o popups)</span>
		<p>The alignment of data appearing within the box when popup boxes are in use.
		Note: Dates and places will always be aligned left, but the block containing them will follow this alignment.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Box Height Shift (w/o popups)</span>
		<p>The value by which the height of pedigree boxes should be altered for successive generations (in pixels) when popup boxes are not
		in use. This should be a negative number. Default value is -2. If zero is entered, no change in box sizes
		will occur.  The number used will always be an even number, so if an odd number is entered, it will be increased by 1.</p>

		<h3>Vertical Chart</h3>

		<span class="optionhead">Box Width</span>
		<p>The width in pixels of each name box on the vertical chart.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Box Height</span>

		<p>Choose to start the text-based descendancy chart with all generations expanded or collapsed. The user will always have the option
		to expand or collapse individual families.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Show Notes and Custom Events on Register</span>
		<p>Indicates whether notes for individuals and families will be displayed on the Register page.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Register Generations</strong><br/>
		Choose to always show each person when displaying a generation, or avoid redundancy by electing to "Remove individuals
		with no family." That option will only display those individuals when they appear as children. They will not be

		<a name="rel"><p class="subheadbold">Relationship Chart</p></a>
		<span class="optionhead">Initial Relationships</span>
		<p>When a new Relationship chart is requested, this is how many relationships TNG will try to find. As soon as that many
		relationships are found, the process will stop. If your tree contains no complicated relationships, you may want to set
		this to 1 in order to save processing time.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Max Relationships</span>
		<p>If the user believes that more relationships exist, they may want to increase the number of relationships TNG will
		try to find. This number represents to most relationships you will allow the program to search for. Try not to set it
		higher than the level of complexity in your tree. The lower this number is, the more time you will save people as
		they view this chart. For example, if only one relationship exists between two people but you are searching for five,
		TNG will continue searching in vain after the first relationship is found.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Max Generations</span>
		<p>The maximum number of generations you will allow visitors to search at one time on the Relationship page. This will also be the initial default on that page.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Enable Simile timeline</span>
		<p>Along with the standard TNG timeline, you can also display a Simile timeline chart on the same page by choosing "Yes" here. More

		<span class="optionhead">Chart height</span>
		<p>Height in pixels of the event (Simile) timeline. If many events are charted at the same time, some could get pushed
		down off the chart's visible area. If that seems to be happening, it could help to increase this value.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Events to include</span>
		<p>Controls which events will be dislayed on the event timeline. Choose to display all events, or only those that fall
		within the lifespans of the individuals on the chart. If you have a lot of events, choosing to display them all may
		cause the chart to be slighly slower in its initial display.</p>

		<p>Notes: If too many events are on the chart at once, those at the bottom will not be visible. If you have a lot of timeline events and this is a frequent occurrence,
		you might consider increasing the Chart Height (see above). More options are available in timelineconfig.php.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Left Indent</span>
		<p>Horizontal offset to be used for the entire pedigree chart (in pixels). This may be needed, for example, to ensure that the chart does not

		<span class="optionhead">Box Name Size</span>
		<p>The size (in points) of all names on the chart. In no case will the font size be permitted to

		<span class="optionhead">Box Color</span>
		<p>The background color to be used in all pedigree boxes, unless a non-zero colorshift is specified, in which case this will define the background
		color of the first pedigree box on the chart.  Default value is #CCCC99 (khaki; white is #FFFFFF).</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Color Shift</span>
		<p>A percentage value that defines how the color values should be "shifted" up or down (towards white or towards black) over the range of
		all generations shown.  The value entered should be between -100 and 100.  If zero is entered, all pedigree boxes (except perhaps those that are empty &#151; see emptycolor)
		will have the same background color.  The default value is 80, which means that box background color will fade 80% of the way from the original color to white as
		the boxes go from the first generation to the last generation displayed (negative values will fade toward black).</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Empty Color</span>
		<p>The background color to be used in all pedigree boxes for which no data exists.  Default value is #CCCCCC (silver).</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Border Color</span>
		<p>The color to be used for the borders around pedigree boxes and the connector lines.  Default is #000000 (black).</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Shadow Color</span>
		<p>The color to be used for shadows.  Default value is #999999 (gray).</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Shadow Offset</span>
		<p>The offset to be used for including box and connector line shadows (in pixels). A negative number will result in
		shadows that are above, and to the left of boxes and lines.  A positive number will result in shadows that are below, and to the right of boxes and lines.  If the number entered is
		zero, the shadows will not be evident (as they will lie strictly below the boxes and lines.  Default value is 4.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Box Horizontal Separation</span>
		<p>Fixed horizontal separation between generations of pedigree boxes (in pixels). Default value is 31.  If a
		number less than 7 is entered, 7 will be used.  The number used will always be an odd number, so if an even number is entered, it will be increased by 1.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Box Vertical Separation</span>
		<p>Vertical separation between generations of pedigree boxes (in pixels), unless a non-zero Box Height Shift is specified, in
		which case Box Vertical Separation is the fixed horizontal separation between boxes in the last displayed generation. Default value is 11.  If a number
		less than 7 is entered, 7 will be used.  The number used will always be an odd number, so if an even number is entered, it will be increased by 1.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
		the value may be increased, if necessary, to ensure there is room between pedigree boxes for shadows and additional information indicators.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Default PDF Page Size</span>
		<p>The paper size that will be assumed for all PDF reports (visitors may change this before each report created).</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Line Width</span>

		<span class="optionhead">Popup Info Size</span>
		<p>The size (in points) of other chart information (dates and places) inside a popup. In no case will the font size be permitted to
		decrease to less than 7 points.  Default value is 10 (72 points are in one inch).</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Popup Timer</span>
		<p>If popups are being used, the number of milliseconds a popup should remain visible.  Default value is 500 (1/2 second).  There are two conditions
		that can modify the duration of a popup display.  First, if another popup is requested, any previously visible popup is removed.  Second, while the cursor is present over a visible
		popup, the timer defined here will not be used until the cursor is moved "out of" the popup.  By this means, one can explicitly keep a popup visible for an indefinite period of time.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Popup Event</span>
		<p>The mouse event required to display the popup. This event is associated with the arrow indicating that additional information is available. If
		Mouse Down is selected, clicking on the arrow will display the popup. If Mouse Over is selected, the popup will be displayed when the mouse pointer is positioned over the arrow.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Box Width (w/popups)</span>
		<p>Fixed width of all pedigree boxes (in pixels) when popup boxes are in use. Default value is 151. If a number less than 21 is entered, 21 will

		always be an odd number, so if an even number is entered, it will be increased by 1.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Box Alignment (w/popups)</span>
		<p>The alignment of data appearing within the box when popup boxes are not in use.
		Note: Dates and places will always be aligned left, but the block containing them will follow this alignment.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Box Height Shift (w/popups)</span>
		<p>The value by which the height of pedigree boxes should be altered for successive generations (in pixels).
		This should be a negative number. Default value is -2. If zero is entered, no change in box sizes
		will occur.  The number used will always be an even number, so if an odd number is entered, it will be increased by 1.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Include Photos</span>

		<ul>
 		<li>To designate a photo to represent an individual on the pedigree chart, edit the photo (must be one with a thumbnail) and check the box marked <span class="emphasis">Make Default</span> under the link to the desired individual and save the page. The existing thumbnail will then be used on the pedigree and other charts. The action of selecting <span class="choice">Make Default</span> used to copy the existing thumbnail to a new location, with the copied file being named <span class="emphasis">Mtreename.###.ext</span>, where <span class="emphasis">treename</span> was the name of the tree to which the person belonged, <span class="emphasis">###</span> was the GEDCOM person ID and ext was the Photos Extension defined above (i.e., <span class="example">MLythgoe.I567.jpg</span>). This convention is no longer used, but existing thumbnails created in that manner will still be used and will take precedence. <span class="emphasis">NOTE:</span> You can still create default thumbnails manually in this manner if you don't want the default photo to be derived from any other photo linked to the individual.</li>
		
		<li>If an image is located using the foregoing convention, the size may be scaled downward, if necessary, to fit within the height of the associated pedigree box.  <span class="emphasis">Upward</span> scaling is not done, however, so that picture quality is not compromised. It should also be noted that any downward scaling of the display	does not affect the size of the photo file. In other words, just because the picture looks smaller does not mean it will download any quicker than it would if it were displayed in its normal size. Therefore, large photos should definitely not be used for pedigree images as the download time of the entire page would be severely affected.</li>
		
		<li>The inclusion of photos will affect the space remaining in pedigree boxes for names and other information.  As such, it may be advisable to <span class="emphasis">tune</span> box and font sizes using previously described configuration options, or to select the <span class="choice">overflow</span> option described above.</li>
