		<a name="what"><p class="subheadbold">What are Secondary Processes?</p></a>
		<p>Secondary Processes are operations you may want to perform on your data directly following an import. To perform one of these operations,
		you must first select whether it should apply to "All Trees" or
		only one tree in particular. If only one tree, select that tree here. Operations you can perform include:</p>
		
		<span class="optionhead">Track Lines</span>
		<p>Once you have imported your data, click here to trace through the selected tree and mark all individuals with children. This will allow visitors
		to your site to more easily find your primary lines of descent.</p>
		
		<span class="optionhead">Sort Children</span>
		<p>Sort the children in each family of the selected tree according to birth date. This will supersede any previous sorting done in
		other parts of TNG or in your desktop application.</p>
		
		<span class="optionhead">Sort Spouses</span>
		<p>Sort spouses for each person of the selected tree according to marriage date. This will supersede any previous sorting done in
		other parts of TNG or in your desktop application.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Relabel Branches</span>
		<p>Re-importing your GEDCOM with the <span class="emphasis">Replace All Data</span> option will cause any previously existing branch labels to be
		removed. Click this button to restore those labels (IDs must match those from your previous data).</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Create GENDEX</span>
		<p>Create an indexable file in GENDEX format. You determine the folder name (where the file will be stored) in the General Settings.
		If you selected "All Trees", this file will be named "gendex.txt". If you selected a tree, the name of your GENDEX file will be the TreeID (not the Tree Name),
		plus .txt for an extension. To have the file indexed by GENDEX, visit
		<a href="http://www.gendexnetwork.org">GenDex Network</a> or <a href="http://www.familytreeseeker.com">FamilyTreeSeeker.com</a> for further instructions.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Post your GENDEX file on the TNG Network</span>
		<p>To have the file indexed by GENDEX, visit <a href="http://www.gendexnetwork.org">GenDex Network</a> or <a href="http://www.familytreeseeker.com">FamilyTreeSeeker.com</a>.
		You will be asked to create an account, after which you will be able to import your GENDEX file. Any time you want to update your listings on the TNG Network,
		you will need to recreate and re-import your GENDEX file.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Trim Media Menus</span>
		<p>TNG includes menu options for several standard media collections (Photos, Documents, Histories, Headstones, Videos and Recordings). If you don't have any items
		for one or more	of those collections, you can remove them from the menus by clicking this option. If you add an item for any of the "trimmed" collections in
		the future, it will automatically be added back for you.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Refresh Living</span>
		<p>Find all individuals who have no death date and who were born recently enough to still be alive, then mark them as "Living". The exact number of years is dictated by
			the option on the Import Settings page labeled "If no death date, assume deceased if older than". Also mark any families as Living where
			these individuals are listed as a spouse. Conversely, this utility will also find all individuals
			who have a death or burial date, or who were not born within that timeframe, and mark them as deceased.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Make Private</span>
		<p>Find all individuals who died in the recent past and mark them as "Private". The exact number of years comes from the "Assume private if not dead this many years"
			option on the Import Settings page. Also mark any families as Private where these individuals are listed as a spouse.
			Unlike the Refresh Living utility, this will not remove the Private designation from any individual.</p>
