"62","NI0679","fitzvalley","Isaac Griffin, a son of tavern keeper Samuel Griffin and his wife Martha, was born February 27, 1751, in Duck Creek Hundred, Kent County, Delaware.  This was near the present town of Smyrna.  He grew into 
an imposing figure of a man--six feet two inches tall, physically powerful, black hair, very dark complexion, deep blue eyes, and features of the Roman type.  generally he was modest and retiring, but had something of a reckless disposition, and he was quick to resent an insult.

When Isaac was eighteen he inherited 177 pounds from his father, a considerable sum in those days.  He appears to have used it wisely, acquiring land in the area.  In 1774 he had won the heart of a young Quakeress, names Mary Morris, whose family Were strict Friends.  She was locked in a room upstairs to prevent her union with the young worldling.  He found out the situation, obtained a ladder, put it to the window, and she climbed down and eloped with him.  A meeting of the Friends was called, when she was notified that, \"If thee will say thee is sorry that thee married Isaac, thee can stay in.\"  But as she would not say it, she was expelled from their membership.  Mary was a daughter of James and Ann (Tilton) Morris of Duck Creek Cross Roads, and was born on July 28, 1756.

In January 1776 Isaac enlisted in the Continental army, for one year, in Colonel Haslet\'s regiment, 1st Company, Captain John Patten.  He went into active Service in August, and was under fire several times.  He re-enlisted for the duration of the war.  During his service he was mainly instrumental in capturing the leader of a group of Tories, Cheney Clow.  The adherents of Clow hated Griffin intensely, and after the close of the war his personal safety was endangered.

Isaac, like the rest of his family at that time, was a slave owner.  He must have still felt some Quaker influence, for it is recorded in the manumission book of the Friends\' Meeting of Duck Creek December 23, 1782 that he freed his slaves.

In October 1783 he had his first recorded brush with politics. At a general election held at Duck Creek Cross Roads some former Tories who had not taken the oath of allegiance were allowed to vote.  Members on the Griffin family objected strongly, and in the resulting disorderly and Violent proceedings a box containing the votes was carried away.

His enemies constantly harassing him, Isaac Began investing in land in Fayette County, Pennsylvania with the intention of Moving.  The Indians still lingering near, his wife feared to move, so he sold the land.  Later, however, she relented, although she had lost her health, and he eventually bought several farms in Fayette County.  By 1794 they were established in their new home, and he was appointed Justice of the Peace.  He served in this capacity for several years.  In 1807 he was elected to the State Legislature, and was re-elected until he had served four successive terms.  In 1812 he was elected to Congress.  It is related of him that upon being notified of this election he brought cloth of home manufacture to Thomas Williams, Esq., of New Geneve, for the purpose of having his make him a suit of clothes.  He informed the persons present that \"he raised the sheep, carded, spun, dyed and wove the cloth on his premises.\"  Also in this year a gloom was cast over the family when his favorite son, James, was killed in the war with England.

Soon after arriving at their new home in Pennsylvania, Mary joined the Seventh-Day Baptist Church, and remained a consistent member until her death, which occurred in her eightieth year, although she had been an invalid for fifty years.  Isaac gave his support to the regular baptist church, but he was not a member.  This is said to have caused them to have a Sabbath (Saturday) and a Sunday in their house,  but this occasioned no jar, for everything moved on smoothly, and they traveled like\'s pathway in harmony, although differing widely in most things.  The daughters were sent to finishing school in Delaware, the journey there and back being made on horseback.

In 1824 Isaac lost his election due to his opposition to General Jackson.  This personal dislike was because\\cause of Jackson ordering the hanging of two men in Florida after they had been cleared by court-martial.  After Isaac retired from public life he remained on his farm until his death October 12,1827, caused by a fall from a loaded wagon.  He was buried on the farm where he lived and died.  Also buried in the same place are his wife Mary (Morris) Griffin, who passed away May 23, 1835; and two unmarried daughters, Martha and Margaret.

James Morris (Jr) a son of James Morris and Margaret Cook, was born June 14,1723, probably in Kent County, Delaware.  His was a Quaker upbringing, but he became a Lieutenant in the Militia in King George\'s War (1744-1748), most unbecoming to a Quaker.

James was married March 6, 1750 to Ann Tilton.  she was  born January 4, 1730, a daughter of John and Ann Tilton.  this marriage was considered irregular by the Friends (Quakers) of the Duck Creek Delaware monthly meeting, and James was charged with Transgression and marriage, at the monthly meeting held June 19, 1751, having married \"one not a Friend\" and marrying our of the unity of Friends.  In the following year, at a monthly meeting held August 17, 1752, James made acknowledgement of his error, and it was received as \"satisfactory\" to the meeting.  He appears to have continued in the Society of Friends, until he was complained against in 1779 for \"keeping Negroes in slavery\", after which he was testified against in 1780.

Ann (Tilton) Morris died May 25, 1762.

James was commissioned a Justice of the Peace of Kent County, Delaware, November 1, 1764.  He died June 16, 1786, and left his house and 500 acres to son James in his will.  There was a memorandum in his note book that his \"framed dwelling house at the cross roads of Duck Creek was built by William Beachman  and John Walston Carps, 1767.  His daughter Mary Griffin was left a tract of land and marsh \"whereon Moses Thompson lives (except a lot of six acres)\". also a moiety of land in New Castle county, Delaware, bought of Alexander Cham and Thomas Brown, also part of lo  of ground at Duck Creek cross roads.

     Peter and Beret moved to Duluth in 1902 and to a homestead in Holt in 1910.

Ronald (Babe) came to California when he was 19 with two of his frien ds
from Indiana.  They went to Whittier CA where his friends stayed.  Dad
wanted to live in the country and be a cattle rancher so he headed for
Lancaster CA where he met Frances Rauch, his wife for nearly 41 years.
After he and Frances were married they went to Bloomingdale Ind to li ve,
but when they found that they were about to become a family, they ret urned
to Lancaster CA to stay and raise their 5 children.  Four of which we re
born in and around Lancaster.  The first three were born in Dr. Savag e\'s
Hospital in Town and Becky at home out in the old Tierra Bonita distr ict,
out east of town.
He missed WW 1 as he was too young, and WW 2 because he was too old .  So
he spent the war building B17\'s at Lockheed in Burbank CA where he wo rked
from 1942 until his heart attack in 1958, after which he retired an d helped
Frances with her Amway business. The Swaim family moved from Lancaste r CA
in Dec 1934 to Venice CA Then to Santa Maria in the spring of 1935, i n the
fall of 1935 we moved to Santa Monica.  During this time he and his f ather-
in-law, N H Rauch and his brother-in-law, George Rauch formed a Compa ny to
sell wood.  Babe cut, the reason for moving up to Nipomo, near Sant a Maria.
George drove the truck to haul the wood to LA and N.H. found the cust omers
and sold the wood.  Because of Mother\'s health in Santa Monica, and a lso
because I was coughing and unable to go to school, dad sold out and w e moved
to AZ.  My cough cleared up within a week and was able to start schoo l again
and it was dicovered that mother\'s illness was caused by her heart no t by the
climate.  We moved to AZ in Feb of 1937 and moved back to CA in Marc h to
Tarzana then we moved to the West Adams district of LA about Nov 193 7 because
it was to far for dad and grandpa to drive in to work every day.  Ou r grand-
parents were living with us because of mother\'s health and dad was no w working
for his father-in-law and brother-in-law.  During the summer of 193 8 we moved
to Culver City over the store which was now called R & S Feed & Fuel.
Easter Vacation of 1939 mother was now strong enough to care for us s o we
moved back to Lancaster where dad got a job working a ranch in the De l Sur
district where I finished grammer school and started hi\'school.  We m oved into
town, Lancaster before school started in fall with dad working fo r a farm
equipment Co.  The pay was not very good so in Dec 1940 we moved bac k to
Culver City and dad went back to work driving a truck for R & S  an d then
for Northern & Western Transportation Co\'s.  With the war starting i n Dec 1941
dad got a job with Lockheed and we moved again this time to North Hol lywood
where mom and dad lived until they moved to Poway CA about 1962.
While he was working at Lockheed he suffered a major heart attack i n 1958
which forced his retirement.  The attack was caused by working in th e fuel
tanks of a jet.  The fumes burned his lungs which caused blood clout s to
form and enter his blood stream causing an aneurysm to form near hi s heart.
This caused his death in 1965.

Frances lived in Fulton Co. Ill until she was about ten, then, because
her father had TB the family sold their farm and moved to a cattle
ranch in Colorado Springs CO where the family lived until about 1920
when her parents went broke and left to live in Pueblo CO.  From there
the family, which was really hard up by this time, built a canvas
house on the back of an old flat bed truck and traveled to Yuma AZ,
from there they traveled across the old plank road into California
and ended up in San Fernando CA where Grandfather found a job working
for a turkey ranch about 60 miles away in the Antelope Valley.
Here Grandfather was able to get ahead enough to homestead a ranch in
the Tierra Bonita district east of Lancaster.  This is where France s met
Babe(Ronald) Swaim.  After I was born, Babe & Frances lived and dad w orked for his father-in-law until after Ronald Jr. was born. Then w e moved to another ranch near-by called Avreys.  From there we move d to McDonald\'s
ranch and then to the dairy where dad drove the milk truck until we
moved to Venice CA in Dec 1934.  Early in 1935, in Feb. I think, we m oved up to Nipoma, near Santa Maria, where dad cut wood for George t o haul to LA for Grandpa Rauch to sell.  Ronald Jr and I finished th e school year there, then  we moved back to Santa Monica in late Aug . or first of Sept. and I, Ronald, and Richard started school at McKi nley.  We stayed there with Granddad, George, and Babe in the wood bu siness.  We stayed there from Sept. 1935 until Feb.1937 when we move d to AZ because the doctor thought mother had TB.  Uncle Arthur and h is family moved to Nipoma to cut the wood, with Daddy driving the tru ck.  We only lived in AZ one month as the doctors over there said mot her had had a heart attact due, I think to stress, so we were able t o move back to CA and Daddy back to working with George & Grandpa i n the wood business, but now he was no longer a pardner, but an emplo yee.  Ronald, Richard, and I finished out the school year living in T arzania.  Becky had started to school in Santa Monica, but couldn\'t f inish the year as Tarzania didn\'t have a kindergarden.  Becky then st arted first grade there, but then we moved again to the West Adams di strict in LA where I graduated from the sixth in Feb. of 1938.  Whe n mother got sick, we started living with our Grandmother & Grandfath er Rauch, so Grandma could take care of mother and us kids.  That sum mer, before school started again, we moved over the store in Culver C ity.  That winter, mother started to feel that she was well enough t o start caring for us again.  So in March or April of 1939 we moved b ack up to Lancaster where I graduated from the eighth grade and enter ed Antelope Valley Hi\'school.

He wanted to run away and join the Union Army, but was stopped by his mother (Rebecca Robinson) who promised him that if he stayed at home she would see that he got a complete education.  At age 20 he entered Lafayette College, graduating in 1871.  James\' education at Lafayette College earned him an appointment to Brazil for the Presbytarian Board of Foreign Missions.  His marriage to Amanda Louise Snyder in November of 1874 was followed shortly by their arrival in Brazil where, in August, 1875, their daughter, Adielah Genevieve, was born.  
At about the time their second daughter, Mabel Louise, was born, both hers and Louise\'s health took a bad turn, and the whole family was forced to return to Ohio.  In 1880, battling illness, both Louise and her younger daughter died. James returned to Brazil in August, 1881, leaving his surviving daughter with the sisters of his late wife.  At about the same time James returned to Brazil, Sophia Amanda Dale was assigned to teach there at Escola Americana (later McKenzie University).  Sophia and James met and were married in the latter part of 1882.  Performing the ceremonies was Robert Lenington, the husband of Sophia\'s older sister, Martha.  Son Leslie Robert and daughter Edna Dale were born there, and when Sophia contracted a severe case of malaria, the family was again forced to move back to Ohio, settling in and taking care of James\' father, Robert, on his farm in Olivesburg.  Anna Rebecca, Ruth Alden, and Howard Alexander were all born at the Olivesburg farm.  In 1897 the family moved to Wooster, Ohio, where Norma Christine was born.  In 1900, James returned to Brazil, where he stayed for 3 years, until Sophia\'s illness in 1903 called him back.  In 1904, James res- ponded to the request of the Mission Board to serve as \'Stated Supply\' at two churches in California, one in Centerville(now Fremont), and the other at Alvarado.  In 1910, James retired from the ministry.  He spent his remaining years enjoying his large family.  He died 8 months before his youngest daugh-
ter gave birth to his final grandchild, Beverly Anne Miller.

Sophia went to live with her oldest sister, Martha, who had married the Rev. Robert Lenington and gone to Brazil as Presbyterian missionaries.  They were pioneers to Brazil in 1868.  This determined Sophia to become a missionary, also.  She returned to the U. S. to work her way through college, graduating from the Univ. of Illinois with her teaching credentials.  Heeding the call of the church, and eager to rejoin her sister, Sophia was assigned to teach in the girls\' school (later McKenzie University), in Sao Paolo, Brazil, where she met and married the Reverend James Theodore Houston."

Colonel Robert G. Shaver

A source of interesting information about the Thirty-eighth ArkansasConfederate Infantry is theobituary of its organizer and commander.Colonel Robert Glenn Shaver.
From the Confederate Veteran, Volume XXIII, pages 178-179:
Col. Robert G. Shaver
By Col. V. Y. Cook, Batesville, Arkansas
\"Colonel Robert G. Shaver died at the home of his daughter; Mrs. P. B.Williams, at Foreman, Arkansas, on January 13, 1915, aged eighty-fouryears. He came to Arkansas with his parents from Sullivan County; EastTennessee, in 1850, locating at Batesville, where in 1856 he wasmarried to Miss Adelaide Louise Ringgold, a beautiful and accomplisheddaughter of Col. John Ringgold, one of the State\'s most prominentcitizens. Some three years later he removed to Lawrence County, wherehe was licensed to practice law
\"In the spring of 1861 he recruited and organized the 7th ArkansasInfantry for the Confederate army and was elected its first colonel.He and his regiment saw service at Columbus and Bowling Green, Ky, andon the evacuation of the latter place by General Albert SidneyJohnston in February; 1862, Colonel Shaver; as senior colonel of thebrigade in which his regiment was serving, commanded the rear guard ofGeneral Johnston\'s army to Nashville, Tenn., a most critical period.
\"At Shiloh, April 6 and 7, 1862, Colonel Shaver, still in command ofthe brigade - i.e., the 1st Brigade - i.e., Hindman\'s Division, 3dArmy Corps, composed of the 2d, 6th, and 7th Arkansas Infantry and the3d Confederate Infantry; two-thirds of the latter regiment also beingArkansans - rose level to his country\'s need, and the soldiers whofollowed him were of the very best type. Colonel Shaver initiated thefight on the Confederate right early Sunday morning, the 6th, wherethe fighting was fierce and incessant throughout that bloody struggle,a struggle in which brothers were standard bearers of the opposingforces, and where he led there was much carnage; yet victory was hisat every point, as his troops surged forward in conjunction with hisalignment of the Confederate center and left wing, pushing theFederals back toward the Tennessee River; where late in the afternoonthey appeared a conglomerated mass of fugitives on the river bankseeking the friendly aegis of the Federal gunboats.
\"The 7th Arkansas, Colonel Shaver\'s own regiment, went into action onthe left of the brigade.  Lieutenant Colonel Deane commanding, withits drum-and-fife corps playing Granny, Will Your Dog Bite?
\"Colonel Shaver had two horses killed under him during the day and oneon the following day, when he and his brigade continued to fightgallantly and effectively. General Hardee, in his report of thebattle, said that Colonel Shaver\'s conduct was most satisfactory,skillful, and exemplary throughout both days\' fighting.
\"Early in June, 1862, Colonel Shaver; with General Hindman, wastransferred to the Trans-Mississippi Department; and at Jacksonport,Ark., on the 8th of September of that year; Colonel Shaver organizedthe 38th Arkansas Infantry, of which he was unanimously electedcolonel and which he continued to command during the various campaignsand battles in that department. In the fall of 1864, at thereorganization of the Army of the Trans-Mississippi, Colonel Shaverwas again elected colonel of the 38th, and on the same day, in adifferent field, he was also elected colonel of Shaver\'s 27th ArkansasInfantry. Gen. Kirby Smith consolidated these two regiments, and theywere known thenceforth until the surrender, in June, 1865, as Shaver\'sInfantry Regiment. He participated in all the principal battles foughtin the Trans -Mississippi Department after June, 1862, among whichwere Prairie Grove, Mansfield, Jenkins\'s Ferry; Poison Springs, MarksMill, and all the battles incident to Gen. Dick Taylor\'s Red Rivercampaign against General Banks, during all of which he displayed hisusual gallantry and resourcefulness. That Colonel Shaver was notkilled was not his fault, for he gave the Federals every opportunityon many fields.
\"At the evacuation of Little Rock, September 10, 1863, Colonel Shaverwas in command of his brigade and covered the Confederate retreat outof the city southward. He was greatly chagrined and deeply mortifiedthat he was not permitted to engage the enemy, and he always contendedthat General Price should have offered battle; that his forces werenumerically superior to the Federals under General Steele and were infine trim and anxious to fight. It has been truthfully said of ColonelShaver that he had rather fight than eat, even after a week\'ssubsistence on half rations and those who knew him and saw him on thedifferent battle fields can well testify to his worth as a resourcefulofficer and a tenacious fighter. He was a soldier by intuition,adaptability, and desire, and withal a strategist and tactician, awarrior with but few peers. He is mentioned in twelve differentvolumes and on many pages of the \"Records\" of the Union andConfederate armies, made up of the reports of the various commandinggenerals and published after the war by the government.
\"Colonel Shaver not only had no friends at court, but much strongopposition caused by a political fight engendered in a State campaignin 1860. One of the defeated candidates for State honors, being inhigh authority at Richmond in the Confederate Senate, always opposedColonel Shaver\'s promotion; otherwise he would certainly have attainedat least the rank of major general. With that rank opportunities wouldhave offered which he would have availed effectively, thereby placinghim beyond the reach of the deadly enmity of the politician; for as amilitary genius he was Gen. Pat Cleburne equal in every respect, andeverybody knows there were none better than Cleburne.
\"Colonel Shaver\'s well-earned sobriquet of \"Fighting Bob Shaver\" wasknown throughout the different armies in which he served. He waswounded four times and had six horses killed under him in action.
\"A poem on the Arkansas Confederate soldier mentions Colonel Shaver inone of its stanzas, as follows:
\"We fought with Lee at Gettysburg,
with Clehurne always our saver,
With Bragg at Chickamauga Creek,
at Shiloh with Bob Shaver.\"
\"So loyal was Colonel Shaver to the Confederate cause that he nevercomplained of the ungenerous and untoward opposition to him by thepoliticians and carried the heart wound to his grave without a murmur.
\"Colonel Shaver was a member of the Grand Council of the Ku-Klux Klan,and many of the Latin terms which expressed its polities and tenantsbore the earmarks of his ability and scholarly attainments. He was thehighest ranking officer of the Klan in Arkansas, General Forrest beingthe highest in the entire Klan, its commander in chief. Early in thewinter of 1868 Colonel Shaver; on account of his connection with theKlan in Arkansas, and especially his campaign in Woodruff County, inwhich he participated in two skirmishes against Clayton\'s Militia, wasforced by the Clayton regime of carpetbaggers, then in power inArkansas, to leave the United States, going to British Honduras, wherehe remained for several years. Returning to Arkansas, he was appointedsheriff of Howard County by Gov. Elisha Baxter, the carpetbaggers inthe meantime having been dethroned. Later he was appointed majorgeneral of the Arkansas State Guard, which he at once reorganized, andin 1896 he was elected Commander of the Arkansas Division, UnitedConfederate Veterans, and at once gave to it its first semblance oforganization. This position he held for two years; and notwithstanding his great popularity, fitness, and adaptability for theposition, he declined further election, as had been the custompreviously and since, with one lamentable exception. This he did thatother comrades might share this great and exalted honor.  He wasgreatly adverse to scrambling for U. C. V positions in the State andgave his influence for rotation after a term of two years.
\"Camp Shaver where the Confederate veterans were camped during theLittle Rock Confederate  Reunion in 1911, was named for ColonelShaver; and he was further honored by being placed in command of theencampment. His duties were executed with loving kindness toward theold soldiers under his charge, and yet with such military precisionthat a successful discipline was accomplished, attractive andbeneficial to those participating.
\"His memory is embalmed in the hearts of his countrymen, and long anddeeply will they remember and appreciate his heroic service for thiscountry\'s cause.\"

"326","NI5485","fitzvalley","James lived on the Maryland Eastern Shore, near Salisbury, where kin still live, before moving to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania in what was known as the Conestoga Manor.  The Pattersons have been in the Maryland and Pennsylvania areas as early as 1660.  He was instrumental in the Cresaps War when Marylanders tried to move the State line north.  This trouble started in 1681 and in 1683 Lord Baltimore issued a proclamation by which he claimed jurisdiction over the tract of land on the west of the Deleware Bay and River now held by William Penn by deed of the Duke of York.  William Penn died in 1718 after requesting that the King settle this dispute.  Penn personnally went to England to plead his case, but the King could not reconcile Penn and Lord Baltimore.  In 1731 Thomas Cresop obtained grants from Lord Baltimore for the land upon which James Patterson settled.  In May of 1732 Lord Baltimore and the Pennsylvania propietaries agreed to a solution.  The war ended in 1738, after Jame\'s death, and the King of England\'s order in Council of the 25th of May 1738.

James traveled to Lancaster County Pennsylvania from Salisbury, Maryland by canoe on the Susquehanna River with his family.  He was warrented 500 acres in Conestoga Manor in 1718, the same year that his benefactor William Penn died.  The warrent was confirmed by Thomas Penn.  Conestoga Manor consisted of 16,000 acres and was officially formed March 1, 1718 by order of James Logan.  



James\'s name appears on the first assessment list of Conestoga Township.  On November 21, 1734 Thomas Penn awarded James and Susanna 200 additional acres where they built their home in which he died and in which his two famous half-brothers General James Ewing and Colonel John Connolly were born.

James and Susanna were Charter Members of the Donegal Presbyterian Church which was founded in Lancaster County, Pa near Elizabethtown and Maytown.  The Church was founded by Scottish families who fled their previous homes in Northern Ireland. The Church was founded sometime prior to 1721."
"327","NI5486","fitzvalley","Susanna Howard was a remarkable woman.  She married a 2nd time in 1736 to Captain Thomas Ewing by whom she became the mother of General James Ewing and Captain John Ewing of the Revolutionary War they also had sons William and Samuel who died at very young ages.  In 1742 she married her 3rd husban, John Connolly by whom she became the mother of the notorious Tory, Dr. John Connolly who was born in 1742.

"332","NI5494","fitzvalley","James lived near where Marietta, Pennsylvania now is located.

He served with the 1st Battalion, Pennsylvania Regiment, during the Revolutionary War.  This unit was commanded by Colonel Conrad Weiser.  He was commissioned May 25, 1748 as a Captain.  He also commanded Fort Hunter to protect Paxtang Township.  He was commissioned again on December 10, 1756.

James was known by the indians as \"Big Shot\" and his son Wiilliam was known as \"Long Gun\".

James and the family servant were made prisoners, along with James Lowe, on November 26, 1732 during the local Cresap War.  The instigators were led by a man named Cresap who acting on the instructions of Lord Baltimore tried to claim land above what is now the Mason Dixon Line for Maryland.

The town of Mexico, Pennsylvania was layed out in 1806 near the site of Patterson\'s Fort.  A statue commemerates the site and James, Mary, and son William.

Mary and James established a trading post on the banks of the Juniata River with a deed of 407 acres on the north side of the river on February 3, 1755.  This was the first warrent of land issued in what is now Juniata County Pennsylvania, then Fermanagh Township, Cumberland County.  The site was known as Patterson\'s Fort.  They eventually owned more than 1,000 acres with 3 additional warrents dated Feb 5, 1755, Feb 6, 1755, and July 10, 1755.

James is buried in the Mexico Town Cemetary in an unmarked grave.  The site is about 100 yards from Patterson\'s Fort.  The Cemetary was restored in 1975 by the Juniata County Development Commission and the Juniata County Historical Society. The Cemetary is maintained currently by the Lost Creek Mennonite Congregation.  The Cemetary is marked by a sign stating that Capt James Patterson, a pioneer and soldier of the French and Indian Wars (1761-1772) is buried in an unmarked grave at this site.  The earliest marked grave is listed as 1804 and the last burial took place in 1871.

James had inherited the lands of his father consisting of about 300 acres in Conycocheek.

York County Pennsylvania Court Records show that a James Ward filed suit against James during the Court Session of July 1957.  Another suit dated Jan 1758 was initiated by the Administrators of a Mr. Theopbulus, their names were Mary & William Theopbulus.  In July 1758 a suit was started by Susannah Ramsey, the executress of William Ramsey (deceased) against James and it was still an active case in April 1759.  A final suit shows the plaintiff as Mary Simonton which was filed April
of 1759.  None of the suits whowed any final actions.

His will is dated June 9, 1771 and recorded at the Cumberland County, Pa Courthouse in Carlise, Pa and was probated Jan 22, 1772,

History shows that he was born in Mexico, Pennsylvania but probably he was born at the home of his grandfather in Donegal Township Lancaster County.  His mother, who died during childbirth, was buried next door to her father\'s home the day after she died so it should be assumed that she died in Lancaster County and therefor he would have been born at the same location.

Galbraith died suddenly at his farm in Lycoming County in 1801.  In the 1790 census he is shown as owning two slaves.  He built a brick home in Harrisburg 2 doors down from the John Harris home."

He became interested in the teachings of George Fox the Quaker, was sequestered to the vicarage of Kingsbury, 1646; and about the year 1657, renounced his benefice and became a minister among Friends.

Four of his five sons, Thomas, William, John, and James, were all Quakers who settled in West Jersey and Philadelphia, PA.

The Budd Family 1981: 3 centuries of Budds, Betty Budd Carlisle, p17, 18,68:  He was a man of integrity, strength and intelligence and lived his whole life in England. Most of his life, except for his years in Oxford, was lived in the villages of Kingsbury, Episcopi, Martock, and Montacute, where he was a Vicar in the Church of England, and later a Quaker convert, minister and martyr.  All of these villages are within a few miles of each other in the lush and beautiful Somerset levels; and Ilchester, where he was imprisoned and died, was in the same small circle.  Proof of his being the father of the America clan was obtained by Mr. Robin Bush searching boxes of papers etc. from the early 1600\'s and translating the latin to verify the marriage and children data.  These papers support that Susannah Prigge was the mother of all of Thomas\'s children. Marriage date listed.

John was born in March 1340 in Ghent (M.E., Gaunt), now in Belgium. In 1359 he married Blanche, daughter of Henry, duke of Lancaster; when Henry died, John became duke.John of Gaunt played an important part in the wars of the period between England and France and between England and Spain. He commanded a division of the English army, led by the Black Prince, that defeated the army of Henry (later Henry II, king of Castile and León) at Nájera in 1367. As a result of his second marriage, to Constance, daughter of Peter the Cruel (king of Castile and León), John laid claim to the throne of Castile. During the Hundred Years\' War, he aided (1370-71) the Black Prince against France and established English rule over most of southern France. After a severe illness forced the return of the Black Prince to England, John took command of the English armies; by 1380 he had lost much of the territory the English had previously won. In 1386 John invaded Castile, but was defeated by John I, king of Castile and León. John of Gaunt gave up his claim to Castile and León in 1387, when his daughter married Henry, later Henry III, king of Castile and León.John of Gaunt was also prominent in English affairs. Together with Alice Perrers, his father\'s mistress, John dominated the English government. He was opposed by Parliament and by the Black Prince. In 1376 Parliament banished Alice Perrers and curtailed John\'s powers. The death of the Black Prince that year and the dissolution of Parliament, however, enabled John to regain his power. In 1377, on the death of Edward III and the accession of Richard II (John\'s nephew and son of the Black Prince), John gave up his control of the government and thereafter played the role of peacemaker; he also supported the king, by whom he was made (1390) duke of Aquitaine. In 1396, after the death of his second wife, John married his mistress Catherine Swynford, and Richard legitimized their children the following year. Saddened by the exile (1398) of his son, Henry of Lancaster (later King Henry IV of England), John died on February 3 of the following year.

Edward I was born at Westminster in 1239, and was named for his father Henry III\'s favourite saint, Edward the Confessor. He was heir to wide domains and many troubles, and had an early taste of both. In 1252 he was given charge of the troublesome but lucrative Gascon territories. Two years later he was married to Eleanor of Castile---a political marriage, but one that was to turn into a love-match.

There was little time to enjoy it at first, for Edward was now pitched into the discords of the English baronial revolt. His father was neither a good leader of men, nor a good soldier, so the burden was thrust upon his young son. The barons\' leader, Simon de Montfort, was Edward\'s uncle, and there is no doubt that the prince was both attracted to his uncle\'s ideas of government, and also deeply influenced by his military tactics. But after the defeat at Lewes, and a humiliating imprisonment, his admiration turned to hostility, which was only sated with the rout of Evesham in 1265.

In the next few years he acted as a moderating influence on his father\'s vindictive wrath, and saw to it that the settlement with the baronial opposition should not in itself provoke a further uprising.

In 1270 he was at last able to go off on crusade, when he brought relief to Acre. His military reputation now soared, and in 1272 he suffered an attack from an assassin, in which he was grazed by a poisoned dagger in the scuffle. He recovered, and was able to negotiate a ten-year truce before returning home, covered with honour.

On landing in Sicily he heard of his father\'s death, but he did not hurry to get back to England, spending a whole year settling his affairs in Gascony first. It was 1274 before England saw him. Once properly seated on the throne, however, he gave every evidence of his vigour and determination to rule. Within two months of the coronation, commissioners were scouring the land completing a survey as large and efficient as any that had been understaken since Domesday. The commissioners enquired into encroachments upon royal rights, and into injustices committed by the king\'s servants; their detailed reports are know to historians as the Hundred Rolls, based as they were on the administrative unit of the hundred.

The evidence of the Hundred Rolls was to be the basis of Edward\'s legislative reforms. A long series of statutes, enacted at the enlarged parliaments introduced by Simon de Montfort, aimed at the improvement of justice at the local as well as the national level, and also tried to rationalise the bewildering array of jurisdictions, known as liberties, the feudal government had seen grow up. Edward had a genuine concern to see justice done, which gained for him the deep admiration of his subjects. He was also very well informed about the localities, for he was constantly on the move, covering distances of about 2,000 miles a year, with a court of perhaps a thousand horses lumbering behind him on the muddy and dangerous medieval roads.

Much larger groups travelled with him when he went to war, and Wales was the first to see his unwelcome visitation. Llewellyn, Prince of Wales, had rather foolishly refused to do homage for his lands at Edward\'s coronation, and in 1277 the King attacked and reduced his dominions by half. Five years later the Prince\'s brother David rose in rebellion, and Llewellyn was forced to join him, only to be killed in a petty foray. With no great leader left to them, the Welsh submitted to annexation, and saw gigantic castles rise in key-points such as Conway, Caernarvon and Harlech, castles that would prevent future revolt. Edward was an arrant colonist, and typically brought back from Wales the great cross of Neath to carry in procession to Westminster for the service of thanksgiving. The Abbey was to see many more proud trophies plundered for its decoration and distinction.

Edward was eager to be off to Palestine once more, but the European situation prevented a new crusade: France and Aragon struggled over the body of Sicily, and the Pope was hopelessly committed as a partisan. Edward now spent long months attempting to bring peace to Europe so that the Christian nations could unite in crusade.

His design for Europe was interrupted by troubles at home. In his prolonged absence corruption throve, and in 1289 the King was forced to conduct an enquiry which resulted, among other things, in the banishment of his chief justice. The same year he had to go north to convene the court that was to judge between the various \'competitors\' for the throne of Scotland. The legalism fascinated him, but in the middle of this interesting judicial wrangle, his wife died. He was heartbroken, and as he accompanied the body from Lincolnshire to London, he ordered elaborate crosses to be set up wherever the cortège rested. The last was Charing Cross. A most beautiful monument was set up in Westminster Abbey, and those who view it can see something of Edward\'s loss.

Back in Scotland he finally adjudged John Balliol\'s claim for the crown to be the best, but forced him to accept vassal status as a quid pro quo. Years of trouble lay ahead: the French made war, the Welsh rebelled, and the Pope made life extrememly difficult for the hard-pressed English king. He continued to demand Edward\'s presence on crusade---which he would have dearly loved, but found impossible; his only contribution was the expulsion of Jews in 1290. Furthermore the Pope had suddenly issued a Bull declaring that the state had no right to tax the clergy, and Edward was desperately short of money for war on three fronts.

These diffficulties explain but do not excuse the viciousness of his actions in the next few years. Scotland had refused to accept him as overlord, and he annexed the land, deposed Balliol, and removed the Stone of Scone to Westminster Abbey in 1296. When Wallace rose as a leader in Scotland, Edward increased the fury of his attack; the rebels received no mercy.

Gradually the King seemed to be achieving his aims. France was satisfied by his marriage to the sister of the French king, and by 1304 Scotland seemed well under his heel, controlled by a policy of ruthless savagery. Edward could at last turn his attention back to English affairs, where disorder was rampant. New justices were sent round on the \'Trailbaston\' commission to seek out the unsavoury Robin Hoods of the land, and gradually order returned.

Inagine then the fury of the aged king when, in 1306, Robert Bruce, who had been his man for the past four years, suddenly went north and was crowned King of Scots. Old, tired, and sick, Edward moved up country to deal with this fresh menace to peace, but was taken very ill on the way. He had to direct the campaign from his bed, and vitriolic letters showered on his commanders accusing them of inaction and failure.

In a last tremendous effort the King got up and gave his litter to Carlisle Cathedral---a typical gesture, again---and set off on horseback. The progress was desperately slow---some two miles a day---but even that was too fast for the sick king, who quickly succumbed and died in July 1307.

Son and father of weak and inefffectual kings, Edward I had many fine qualities which seem to make nonsence of heredity. He was tall and strong, a fine horseman and a doughty warrior. A great leader of men, he was also able to lead to success. He was interested in government and law in a very genuine way. As a personality he was pious, but easily provoked to rage and often vindictive. He was fond of games---so passionately did he love his hawks that when they were ill he sent money to shrines to pray for their recovery. He was generous to the poor, and often a gay companion: he played chess, and loved music and acrobats; once he bet his laundress Matilda that she couldn\'t ride his charger, and she won! Every Easter Monday he paid ransom to his maids if they found him in bed. He loved his two wives, and fussed over their health and that of his children with a pathetic concern---sometimes threatening the doctor with what would happen to him if his patient did not recover. His people feared, respected and remembered him."

It thus came about that the 2nd-6th Earls of Westmorland were actually less well-endowed territorially than their ancestors who had been mere barons.  The pre-eminence of that branch of the family represented by the Earls of Salisbury/Warwick, who stemmed from the second marriage, was made correspondingly easier.

The 1st Earl of Westmorland had multiplicity of children: nine by the first wife, fourteen by his second.  Of his 23 in all, four were peers, three were duchesses and another four daughters the wives of lesser peers; moreover of those three duchesses one was mother of two kings. Between 1450 and 1455 no fewer than 13 members of the family had seats in the House of Lords.  This very fecundity like that of Edward III, engendered quarrels.  There was rivalry between the two branches of the family, which grew from a dispute about family estates into a difference as to dynastic loyalties.  It thus served as an overture to the Wars of the Roses, one which was made even more ominous by a dispute between the Nevilles, represented by the 1st Marquess of Montagu and the Percys.

Sixth Baron Neville of Raby, became a Knight of the Garter and 1st Earl Westmoreland September 29, 1397. As a Lancasterian, he opposed Richard II in 1399 and conveyed Richard\'s resignation to the convention. He assisted in the coronation of Henry IV and was a member of the council of regency appointed to rule in the infancy of King Henry V. With his second marriage to Joan Beaufort, a widowed daughter of John Of Gaunt, fourth son of Edward III, this favorably affected Joan and Ralph\'s wealth and social prestige, making possible brilliant marriages for their children. In 1450, five of Ralph\'s sons, five sons-in-law and several grandsons were in Parliament.

Held many offices, among them Constable of the Tower of London and in 1399, Marshall of England the year he was created Earl of Richmond. He was a member of Richards II\'s privy council, saw service at Agincourt on October 25, 1415 where Henry won a victory over the superior numbers of French owing to his superior generalship.

He married his first wife Margaret, daughter of Hugh, Earl of Stafford by special dispensation from Pope Urban V, because of their close relationship.

The marriage to Joan, his second wife, was a much more distinguished one as the line now descends through the royal house of England. summoned to Parliament from December 6, 1389 to November 30, 1396.

Ralph de Nevill, 4th baron, summoned to parliament from 6 December, 1389, to 30 November, 1396. This nobleman took a leading part in the political drama of his day and sustained it with more than ordinary ability. In the lifetime of his father (9th Richard II), he was joined with Thomas Clifford, son of Lord Clifford, and was appointed a commissionership for the guardianship of the West Marches. In three years after this he succeeded to the title, and in two years subsequently he was one of the commissioners appointed to treat with the Kings of France and Scotland, touching a truce made by them with the King of England. In the 21st Richard II [1378], he was made constable of the Tower of London and shortly afterwards advanced in full parliament to the dignity of Earl of Westmoreland. His lordship was of the privy council to King Richard and had much favour from that monarch, yet he was one of the most active in raising Henry, of Lancaster, to the throne as Henry IV, and was rewarded by the new king in the first year of his reign with a grant of the county and honour of Richmond for his life, and with the great office of Earl Marshal of England. Soon after this, he stoutly resisted the Earl of Northumberland in his rebellion and forced the Percies, who had advanced as far as Durham, to fall back upon Prudhoe, when the battle of Shrewsbury ensued, in which the gallant Hotspur sustained so signal a defeat, and closed his impetuous career. The earl was afterwards governor of the town and castle of Carlisle, warden of the West Marches towards Scotland, and governor of Roxborough. He was also a knight of the Garter. His lordship m. 1st, Lady Margaret Stafford, dau. of Hugh, Earl Stafford, K.G., for which marriage a dispensation was obtained from Pope Urban V, the earl and his bride being within the third and fourth degrees of consanguinity; by this lady he had issue, John, Lord Nevill; Ralph; Maud; Phillippa; Alice; Margaret; Anne; Margery; and Elizabeth.

This nobleman had livery of his lands in the 31st Henry III [1247], and was constituted in two years afterwards constable of Newcastle-under-Lyne. Being one of the lords-marchers he was actively employed for some years against the Welsh and was appointed governor of the castles of Salop and Bridgenorth and sheriff of the counties of Salop and Stafford. In the 47th of Henry III [1263] he was made justice of Ireland; and in the same year, upon the misunderstanding between the king and the barons regarding the provisions of Oxford, being referred to arbitration of the monarch of France, he was one of the noblemen who undertook for the king therein. The next year we find him with Roger de Mortimer and the other barons-marchers giving battle to Llewelyn, Prince of Wales, and afterwards joining the Earl of Gloucester at Evesham in rescuing the king, who had become captive to the Earl of Leicester at the battle of Lewes. In the 52nd of Henry III [1268], his lordship performed a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. James in Galicia, and the following year embarked in the Crusade.

"726","NI35161","fitzvalley","NOTES: Eleanor was only about ten years old when married to the 15 year old Edward of Westminster at Las Huelgas in 1254. Such child marriages were commonplace in Europe in the Middle Ages and the brides were usually consigned to their husbands\' families to complete ther education. The marriages were not consummated until the bride reached a suitable age (usually 14 or 15) and in Eleanor\'s case it seems to have been 18 or 19.Eleanor of Castile (1244?-90), queen consort of England (1272-90), daughter of Ferdinand III, king of Castile and León. In 1254 she married Prince Edward, later Edward I of England, the eldest son of King Henry III. In 1270 she accompanied Edward on the Seventh Crusade. During their absence from England, Henry III died (1272), and Edward succeeded to the throne. Two years later, following their return from the Middle East, Edward and Eleanor were crowned king and queen of England.

"728","NI35353","fitzvalley","1.  Edward II, Plantagenet king of England (1307-1327), whose incompetence and distaste for government finally led to his deposition and murder.  Edward was the fourth son of King Edward I and his first wife, Eleanor of Castile. The deaths of his older brothers made the infant prince heir to the throne; in 1301 he was proclaimed prince of Wales, the first heir apparent in English history to bear that title. The prince was idle and frivolous, with no liking for military campaigning or affairs of state.Believing that the prince\'s close friend Piers Gaveston, a Gascon knight, was a bad influence on the prince, Edward I banished Gaveston. On his father\'s death, however, Edward II recalled his favorite homosexual lover Piers Gaveston from exile, abandoned the campaign against Robert Bruce, and devoted himself to frivolity.Gaveston incurred the opposition of the powerful English barony. The nobles were particularly angered in 1308, when Edward made Gaveston regent for the period of the king\'s absence in France, where he went to marry Isabella, 15, daughter of King Philip IV. Gaveston married the king\'s niece, Margaret of Gloucester, and received the earldom of Cornwall.  In 1311 the barons, led by Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, forcedthe king to appoint from among them a committee of 21 nobles and prelates, called the lords ordainers. They proclaimed a series of ordinances that transferred the ruling power to themselves and excluded the commons and lower clergy from Parliament. After they had twice forced the king to banish Gaveston, and the king had each time recalled him, the English barons finally had the king\'s favorite kidnapped and treacherously executed. In the meantime, Robert Bruce had almost completed his re conquest of Scotland, which he had begun shortly after 1305. In 1314 Edward II and his barons raised an army of some 100,000 men with which to crush Bruce,but in the attempt to lift the siege of Stirling they were decisively defeated (Battle of Bannockburn). For the following eight years the earl of Lancaster virtually ruled thekingdom. In 1322, however, with the advice and help of two new royal favorites, the baron Hugh le Despenser, and his son, also Hugh le Despenser, Edward defeated Lancaster in battle and had him executed. The le Despensers thereupon became de facto rulers of England. They summoned a Parliament in which the commons were included and which repealed the ordinances of 1311 on the ground that they had been passed by the barons only. The repeal was a great step forward in English constitutional development, for it meant that thenceforth no law passed by Parliament was valid unless the House of Commons approved it.  Edward again futilely invaded Scotland in 1322, and in 1323 signed a 13-year truce with Bruce. In 1325 Queen Isabella accompanied the prince of Wales to France, where, in accordance with feudal custom, he did homage to king Charles IV for the fief of Aquitaine. Isabella, who desired to depose the le Despensers, allied herself with some barons who had been exiled by Edward. In 1326, with their leader, Roger de Mortimer,  Isabella raised an army and invaded England. Edward and his favoritesfled, but his wife\'s army pursued and executed the le Despensers.  Edward II was effectively deposed by his wife Isabelle and her lover Mortimer, who had the parliament of Westminster force the king\'s abdication and replace him with his son of 14, who reigned until 1377 as Edward III. Edward II was captured in 1326, deposed in 1327, imprisoned in Berkeley Castle where he was mistreated in hopes that he would die of disease and malnutrition, but the king had a strong constitution, so he was put to death with cruelty September 21; it was announced that he died of natural causes."

He married, before 24 July 1406, Maud, daughter of Thomas (DE CLIFFORD), 6th LORD CLIFFORD, by Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas( DE ROS), LORD ROS. From her he was divorced and, having no issue, he settled the greater part of his estate (although derived through his mother) on his brother of the half blood, Ralph (Nevill), 1st Earl of Westmorland, to the exclusion of his heir, his sister of the whole blood, Elizabeth. He died s.p., 10 December 1430, desiring (in his will) to be buried in St. Mary\'s Abbey, York, \"where I have put my stone.\" His divorced wife Maud married, as 2nd wife, Richard, EARL of CAMBRIDGE, who was executed 5 August 1415.

According to her father\'s Inquisition post mortem she was aged 24 or 26 in 1381, and 27 or 29 according to that of her grandmother in 1384.

Lord Nevill died 17 October 1388, leaving by Elizabeth his wife a son John and a daughter Elizabeth. His widow had assignment of dower 9 November 1388, as well as livery of her father\'s lands, held by her late husband in her right.

She died 5 November 1395 and was probably buried at Spilsby (h). Will dated 18 October at Eresby, directing burial at Spilsby, proved 10 November 1395 at Lincoln. He died 9 August 1396 and was buried at Spilsby.  [Complete Peerage XII/2:660-1, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]

(h) The statement that she was buried at Guisborough, co. York, is based on an obit, giving her date of death, taken from a Guisborough Priory calendar.  There is, however, no mention of her burial there in a list of Guisborough, sepulcures, and it is far more likely that she was buried, in accordance with her will, at Spilsby, where her effigy appears on her 2nd husband\'s tomb."

Henry IV, also called (1377-97) Earl of Derby, or (1397-99) Duke of Hereford, byname Henry Bolingbroke, or Henry de Lancaster (b. April? 1366, Bolinbroke Castle, Lincolnshire, England--d. 20 Mar 1413, London), king of England from 1399 to 1413, the first of three 15-century monarchs from the House of Lancaster.  He gained the crown by usurpation and successfully consolidated his power in the face of repeated uprisings of powerful nobles.  At the same time he was unable to overcome the fiscal and administrative weaknesses that contributed to the eventual downfall of the Lancastrian dynasty.  [Encyclopaedia Britannica]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------

Henry IV (reigned 1399-1413) spent much of the early part of his reign fighting to keep control of his lands. Exiled for life by Richard II in 1399, Henry\'s successful usurpation did not lead to general recognition of his claim (he remained unrecognised as King by Charles VI of France).

An outbreak of the plague in 1400 was accompanied by a revolt in Wales led by Owen Glendower. In 1403, Henry\'s supporters, the Percys of Northumberland, turned against him and conspired with Glendower - the Percys and the Welsh were defeated by Henry at the Battle of Shrewsbury. This victory was followed by the execution of other rebels at York (including the Archbishop in 1405). By 1408 Henry had gained control of the country. Henry was dogged by illness from 1405 onwards; his son played a greater role in government (even opposing the King at times). In 1413, Henry died exhausted, in the Jerusalem Chamber at Westminster Abbey."

His lordship d. at his manor of Aynho, in Northamptonshire, in 1332, when those great estates, falling to the crown, were divided thus-- Warkworth, and the manors in Northumberland, granted to Henry de Perci, are still part of the possessions of the ducal family of Northumberland; Aynho and Horsford, in Northamptonshire and Norfolk, to Ralph de Neville, and his heirs; Clavering, in Essex, to the deceased lord\'s brother Edmund, for life, and in remainder to the above Ralph Neville and his heirs. In this very unjustifiable manner were the descendants of his lordship\'s youngest brother deprived of their fair inheritance.

"809","NI7619","fitzvalley","Edward III (1312-77), king of England (1327-77), who initiated the long, drawn-out struggle with France called the Hundred Years\' War.Edward was born at Windsor on November 13, 1312, the elder son of King Edward II, of the house of Plantagenet. Involved by his mother, Isabella of France, in her intrigues against his father, he was proclaimed king after the latter was forced to abdicate in 1327. During Edward\'s minority, England was nominally ruled by a council of regency, but the actual power was in the hands of Isabella and her paramour, Roger de Mortimer. In 1330, however, the young king staged a palace coup and took the power into his own hands. He had Mortimer hanged and confined his mother to her home.Edward began a series of wars almost directly after he had control of England. Taking advantage of civil war in Scotland in 1333, he invaded the country, defeated the Scots at Halidon Hill, England, and restored Edward de Baliol to the throne of Scotland. Baliol, however, was soon deposed, and later attempts by Edward to establish him permanently as king of Scotland were unsuccessful. In 1337 France came to the aid of Scotland. This action was the culminating point in a series of disagreements between France and England, and Edward declared war on Philip VI of France. In 1340 the English fleet destroyed a larger French fleet off Sluis, the Netherlands. The action resulted in a truce that, although occasionally disturbed, lasted for six years.War broke out again in 1346. Edward, accompanied by his eldest son, Edward the Black Prince, invaded Normandy and won a great victory over France in the Battle of Crécy. He captured Calais in 1347, and a truce was reestablished. Edward returned to England, where he maintained one of the most magnificent courts in Europe. The war with France was renewed in 1355, and again the English armies were successful. The Peace of Calais, in 1360, gave England all of Aquitaine, and Edward in return renounced his claim, first made in 1328, to the French throne.Edward continued to assert his will both domestically and abroad. In 1363 he concluded an agreement with his brother-in-law, David II of Scotland, uniting the two kingdoms in the event of David\'s death without male issue. Three years later Edward repudiated the papacy\'s feudal supremacy over England, held in fief since 1213. He renewed his war with France, disavowing the Peace of Calais. This time, however, the English armies were unsuccessful. After the truce of 1375, Edward retained few of his previously vast possessions in France.The king had, by this time, become senile. He was completely in the power of an avaricious mistress, Alice Perrers, who, along with his fourth son, John of Gaunt, dominated England. Perrers was banished by Parliament in 1376, and Edward himself died at Sheen (now Richmond) on June 21, 1377. He was succeeded by his grandson, Richard II.

William Polk Cummins, born on April 19, 1853, was the son of David J. Cummins (1824-1898), a prominent Delaware businessman and landowner, and Juliet Polk Cummins, daughter of William Polk of Odessa. A native of Smyrna, Delaware, William Cummins had a brother, Albert W. Cummins, who would later work for The Wilmington Morning News, and four sisters: Mrs. Henry Lee, Mrs. Edith Davis, Agnes Cummins, and Susan Cummins. He attended Princeton College, graduating from that institution in 1875, and immediately set out to work in the agricultural industry. Working independently as the manager of Glenfern Farm and involved in the manufacturing of drain tiles and fertilizers, he decided to take on John Cosgriff as a partner in 1884. This partnership lasted some ten years until the death of William Cummins, after which Cosgriff went on to create his own company, Cosgriff, Beck & Hazel, which dealt in the manufacturing of fertilizers as well.
Cummins was quite well-connected, and was an active member of his community. Indeed, in the words of the Wilmington Evening Journal, he was a \"prominent Northern Kent Citizen.\" He married Sarah Esther Williams (1855-1900), daughter of the Delaware state senator James Williams, who was also president of Parvis & Williams. Cummins himself held a place on the Delaware State Central Committee, and for six years served as Director of the National Bank at Smyrna. He traveled frequently on business -- to Wilmington, Philadelphia, or Maryland -- and maintained a wide range of personal contacts. In addition, he was treasurer and choirmaster of St. Paul\'s Episcopal Church in Smyrna.

In 1893 his health began to fail, and in that year he and his wife moved from Glenfern to Smyrna as a result. He had been suffering from kidney problems and heart disease, which prevented him from engaging in the level of activity he had once been used to, and on March 17, 1895 he died in his home.

At the time of his marriage to Abigail Bailliou he was a widower

refugees from England.  The exact time of John\'s arrival in Plymouth

DEACON JOHN DUNHAM
American Immigrant Ancestor
1589 - 1668
    DEACON JOHN DUNHAM, son of Thomas, was born in Scrooby,
Nottinghamshire, England, in 1589.  He was a member of the First
Pilgrim Church in Scrooby.  He left his country at the age of
eighteen when his church moved to Holland in 1607, on account of
religious persecution.  At the age of fourteen years he received his
religious instruction under the guidance of William Brewster, born in
1560 in Scrooby, England.  (John\'s land in Plymouth is said to adjoin
Elder Brewster\'s.)
     In the winter of 1607/8 the members of the Pilgrim Church held
its meetings in the manor house at Scrooby.  In their escape from
Scrooby, the center of the Separatist movement, the exiles first went
to Amsterdam, Holland.  A stay in England was especially dangerous.
After nine months in Amsterdam, they removed to Leyden, Holland,
where John was a member of the First Pilgrim Church in Leyden,
Holland.
      His relatives were bitter against his religious beliefs.  It is
said that he came with the Pilgrims from Holland.  It is not known
just when he came.  It is said that he adopted the name John Goodman
in his escape from Holland.  There is the name John Goodman on the
original voyage and it is said that he died in the first year.  The
Mayflower Society will not accept that they are the same person.
Isaac W. Dunham has him living in Plymouth, with several grants of
land and living next to Elder Brewster after arriving.
     In the book, Ancient Landmarks of Plymouth, 1633 is the first
time the name John Dunham appears.  At that time all land owners had
to be recorded.  At the same time, 1633, he was chosen Deacon of the
First Church of Plymouth by Elder Brewster.  He was a weaver by
trade.
     He married Abigail Wood Barlow, a distant relative, in Holland,
Oct. 22,1622.  She was his second wife, the first was Susanna Kenney,
who had died.  He had three children by his first wife Susanna.
John; Humility; Thomas
     Isaac Dunham\'s Genealogy states that \"It is said that John came
over on the Mayflower under the name of John Goodman, and his family
came later.\"
     Passengers and Ships by Charles E. Banks states, \"The Mayflower
(not the original voyage) Master William Pierce, left Groversend, in
March with thirty-five passengers mostly from Leydon, Holland,
destined for Plymouth, arrived May 15, 1629, no list of names.\"
     All his children but John, 1620, are said to be born in
Plymouth.

betrothed to Abigail Barlow, Oct. 7, 1622, the witness, her father
Thomas and sister Ann of Langerbrugge, Holland.  John was living in
Zevenhuysen in 1626.  He had eleven children, according to the
History of Norway and Paris by Whitman:  John, Benaiah, Jonathan,
Daniel, Persis, Samuel, Benjamin, Joseph, Hannah, Abigail, and Daniel
(Isaac Dunham names Thomas instead of Daniel twice.)
     Deacon John Dunham died March 1, 1668 at the age of 80 years.
He was a servant of God and a useful man in his place, being deacon
of the Plymouth Church.  He made his will Jan. 5, 1668.  In his will
he mentions his oldest son John, two younger sons Ben and Daniel and
daughters Abigail and Persis.  He was Deacon of the Church for thirty-
four years and twenty-one years deputy of Plymouth Colony.  Plymouth
First Church Records, Part 2, page 1.
     His residence after leaving the village was north of Watson\'s
Hill and southwest of the Village of Plymouth.  To the west was a
swamp having an outlet to Town Brook, called \"Dunham\'s Brook.\"  By
means of a dam it became a pond and was separated by a narrow strip
of land known as \"Dunham\'s Neck.\"  This strip was a portion of Deacon
John\'s land, the highway leading to Carver.  In 1907 some of the
offspring lived in the vicinity.  John owned other land in Plymouth.
     Dunham Coat of Arms was adopted by Sir John Dunham, 1498, as the
family shield.

His early life was spent at Crefeld, Germany, where he worked as a blue dryer. A group of one-half dozen neighbors at Crefeld purchased 1800 acres of land in PA from William Penn.  One of these, Lenart Arets, whose wife was a sister of Kunder\'s wife, sold to him 500 acres of this land. A party of 13 families, consisting of 33 persons, left Crefeld. They sailed 24 Jul 1683 on the ship \"Concord,\" and, upon their arrival in PA, located at Germanton.  The Kunder\'s home was on what is now Germanton Avenue. He was a Friend and in 1688 was one of the Friends of Germantown who voiced the first opposition to slavery.  When the town was incorporated in 1692, he was chosen one of the burgesses.
  He married Elin Steypers, supposed to have been a sister of William Steypers. The first three children were born in Crefeld; the others in Germantown.  They assumed the name Conrad. Among their seven children was a son:
     1. Madts, of whom further.

"1031","NI02262","fitzvalley","\"He was a miller by occupation, and was party to numerous land conveyances, owning lands and mills in Bristol Township, Philadelphia County and New Jersey. He was a member of the Society of Friends and attached to the Abington Monthly Meeting. He was an acceptable Public Friend, as ministers of that society are termed, and after 1700, traveled much in the Truth. He was referred to as \'Thomas Potts, the Quaker Preacher\'.  In this work he will be designated, when necessary, as \"Thomas Potts, (Miller).\"

He is first noticed in Pennsylvania, as a witness to the marriage certificate of John Austin and Jane Potts, on 9 mo. 11, 1686. At the marriage of Friends it was customary for those present to sign the marriage certificate as witnesses, the relatives of the contracting parties, signing first and following each other in the order of nearest connection. In this instance, Thomas Potts signs immediately after the mother of the bride, which is a strong evidence of near relationship.

His first purchase of land seems to have been, 150 acres on the west side of the Schuylkill River, bought 10 mo. 5, 1692, from John Blunston, attorney for William Shardlow of London, England. The deed recorded at Philadelphia in Deed Book E. 7, Vol. 9, page 53

On 2 mo. 2, 1695, \"Thomas Potts, of Philadelphia, Yeoman, for ye consideration of 75 pounds current silver money of Pennsilvania, to him paid by David Hugh, of Merion in Welch tract, yeoman,\" conveyed \"all that tract of land with buildings and improvements,\" scituated on the west side of Skoolkill,\" etc., containing 150 acres formerly purchased of John Blunston, the 5th day of the tenth month, 1692. The witnesses to this letter were Thomas Pritchard, David Potts, and ffrancis Cooke.

The earlier public records are frequently quite deficient, as in many instances the recording of deeds was long delayed or they were not recorded at all. The Deed-Books at Philadelphia, show at least some of the land transactions of Thomas Potts. He built two water corn mills or grist mills on a brach of Franklford Creek, not far from Germantown, that were long known as \"Potts\'s Mills,\" or \"Potts\' Mills.\" Among land conveyances, aside from the foregoing, are the following.

On 4 mo. 28, 1699, Thomas Potts, yeoman, purchased 100 acres of land in Bristol Township, from Jacob Shoemaker(or Shoemaker), (NOTE: On June 17, 1699, Jacob Shoemaker made a deed to John Moore for land in Bristol Township, which is partially described as \"Bounded Easterly by former land of said John Moore,
Southerly by the City Liberties, Westerly by the said Jacob\'s Land sold to his Brother-in-law Thomas Potts, and northerly by Land of Samuel Richardson, as the same is actually divided.\" As Thomas Potts was then unmarried, (we believe), to have been brothers-in-law, Jacob Shoemaker must have married Thomas Potts\' sister. This view is supported by the fact that Jacob Shoemaker\'s children signed Potts marrige certificates among relatives, and were in other ways associated with the Potts family. Jacob Shoemaker\'s wife\'s name was Margaret. He came to
Pennsylvania in 1685, a single man.) and on Sept. 6, 1705, he bought another tract in the same Township, from the said Shoemaker.

On \"29, September, 1705,\" Heifert Papen of Germantown, conveyed two tracts of land in Germantown, one parcel of 211/4/ acres and another of 28 3/4 acres, containing together 50 acres, to Samuel Richardson, Richard Townsend,
Thomas Potts, Sr., and Samuel Cart, all of the County of Philadelphia, yeomen. Thomas Potts, Sen., by a deed dated Oct. 2, 1707, sold and set over his interest in these two tracts to the other three partners. On October 8, 1711, Samuel Richardson. Richard Townsend and Samuel Cart, in considersation of L200, executed a deed, conveying this same 50 acres in German Township, to Thomas Potts,Sr., Thomas Canby, John Cadwakkaderm David Potts, Isaac Delaphine, Morris Morrs, Henry Cunnards, William Lukens, etc. These were Trustees of the Friends Meeting, who purchased it for a Meeting House lot. On 2 mo. 18, 1712, the signing of the deed was confirmed by Peter Shoemaker and Isaac Shoemaker. (See Deed-Book, E. 7, Vol 8, p. 175. Philadelphia.)

In 1706, Thomas Potts, of Bristol Township, yeoman, sold to Everard Bolton a one fourth interest in certain lands and two water corn mills or grist mills in Bristol Township, commonly known as \'Potts\'s Mills.\" In the same year Thomas Potts, Sen., of Bristol Township, miller, and George Gray, of the City of Philadelphia, merchant, were parties to several real estate conveyances of lands, etc., in Bristol Township.

On Dec. 26, 1717, Thomas Potts, Sen., of Bristol Township,yeoman, purchased two small tracts of land in said Township from Joshua Fincher and Elizabeth, his wife, On the same day Thomas Potts and Judith, his wife, made a deed to Joshua Fincher for a lot in the same Township.

Among public records are to be found a number of original signatures of Thomas Potts. They are marked by certain characteristics that make them readily recognized and easily distinguished from those of any of his contemporaries who bore the same name.

The papers relating to the decedant\'s estate are in the Register\'s Office at Philadelphia.

Thomas Potts and David Potts were witnesses to the will of William Howell, of Cheltenham Township, Philadelphia County, made 12 mo. 20, 1709. 

Thomas Potts was an earnest and active member of the religious Society of Friends, being attached to the Germantown Prerparative Meeting, which was under the care of the Abington Monthly Meeting. From the minutes of Abington Monthly Meeting (NOTE: The early minutes of Abington Monthly Meeting are very meager
and evidently imcomplete. It is possible that the original minutes were written upon separate slips of paper andsubsequently copied into a book, when some of the slips may have been lost.) and other sources, it appears, that from about 1705 to the end of his life, he devoted himself very largely to the duties of a public Friend or
religious minister, traveling and visiting Friends in the service of Truth, in Maryland, Virginia, New England, the West Indes, England, Ireland, and other places.

In \"Hazard\'s Register,\" it is stated that \"About this time (1705) or the last year, Thomas Potts of Pennsylvania went to pay a visit to Friends in England and Ireland,\" and in 1705 William Penn, writing from England, mentions Thomas Potts as about to return to Pennsylvania. Two years later he again visited England and Ireland, having been granted a Certificate for that purpose by Abington Monthly Meeting on 3 mo. 26, 1707. In the same year Thomas Chalkley mentions Thomas Potts, in his journal, as a companion of himself and Anthony Morris, on a visit
to Friends in the West Indes, from whence they sailed for England. Rutty\'s \"History of the Rise and Progress of the People called Quakers in Ireland, etc., Dublin, 1751,\" has the following, \" In 1707, James Farmer, from Essex, John Bradley, from Cheshire, Thomas Potts, from Pennsylvania, also divers other ministering Friends from this nation, were diligent in the exercise of their gifts, both in meetings held among Friends and strangers.\"

In 1711, he made a visit to Maryland, and on his return immediately prepared for a journey into New England, as it appears from the following entry in the Abington Monthly Meeting minutes of 4 mo. 25, 1711.

\"Our friend Thomas Potts lately returned from Maryland upon ye Service of Truth, & recommended to good Service from Tredevan Creek & now the said Thomas having declared that he finds a concern on him to Visit friends at New England, requests a Certificate In order for ye Said Service, which allso was granted.\"

He was accompanied by Thomas Chalkley upon this visit, and it is probable that they visited Friends on Long Island and at other points on the route of travel. it may be that it was upon this, or a similar journey, Thomas Potts first met Judith Smith,of Flushing, whom he married in the next year. The minutes of Abington Monthly Meeting for 5 mo. 28, 1712, show that, \" A Certificate was granted Thomas Potts in order to proceed on towards Marriage with Judith Smith of Long Island.\"

The marriage was accomplished not long afterwards, as shown by the following abstract from the Friends records of marriages at Long Island. (See New York Genealogical and Biographical Record,Vol. VI, page101.)

\"The foreteenth day of the Sixth Month Ano One thousand seven hundred & twelve. At flushing - Thomas Potts of Bristol Township in ye county of Philadelphia in Pennsilvania and Judith Smith of Flushing, &c.\"

In a latter part of the year 1712, he again visited Friends in Maryland, and on 2 mo. 25, 1715.

\"A Certificate was granted Thomas Potts, in order to go to visit Friends in Barbadoes, upon ye Service of Truth.\"

Sometime after his return he made arrangements to settle in Maryland, and on 11 mo. 30, 1715, \"A Certificate was granted Thomas Potts in order to Settle in Maryland.\"

He removed to Talbot County, Maryland, where he continuued to live for some time. While a resident of Maryland, he issued a letter of attorney to Joseph Kirkbride of Bucks County, empowering him to sell his land, house and mills in Somerset County, New Jersey. The original document remains on file in the office of the
Department of State at Trenton.

No deeds of conveyance of this property have come to the notice of the compiler, and neither the date of purchase nor sale can be given. Stony Brook is a short distance south of the Town of Princeton, and within the limits of the present County of Mercer.

Thomas Potts returned to Pennsylvania from Maryland in about a year and a half, and on 6 mo. 25, 1717, the minutes of Abington Monthly Meeting contain this record, \"Thomas Potts produced a Certificate from Treadevan in Maryland which was read and accepted.\"

He subsequently made one or two other visits to Friends to the southward. On 6 mo. 25, 1718, a Monthly Meeting minute shows that, \"Thomas Potts acquainted friends that he is minded to travail Down Towards ye Capes of Delaware & Desires a Certificate: The Meeting Do appointed Dennis Cundras & John Lucan to make
Enguiry how he leaves his Business.\"

He was frequently appointed to attend Quarterly Meetings, and on 12 mo. 23, 1718, he was appointed \"to visit families.\"

On 1 mo. 30, 1719, this entry, which probably refers to an intended visit to the southward.

\"At this Meeting things was found Clear Relating to Thomas Pots and a Certificate was granted him.\"

On his return this minute was entered on 5 mo. 27, 1719.

\"At this Meeting Thomas Potts having lately Returned from: traveling in Meryland & Virginia Produced a Certificate from Treadaven Monthly Meeting.

Thomas Potts did not survive long after his return from this visit, as he died before October (8mo), 3, 1719, the date on which his will was probated. He was undoubtedly a man of rare worth and exemplary character. William Penn calls him \"honest Thomas Potts,\" and an estimate of his character may be gathered from the Penn and Logan Correspondence.

The age of Thomas Potts has not been ascertained. As he signs as a witness to a marriage certificate in 1686, it is probable that he was then a well grown youth or a young man. When he purchased land in 1692, he must have been above twenty one years of age. It seems reasonable to conclude that he was at least forty years old when he married Judith Smith in 1712, and fifty years or over when Thomas Potts left a will, dated 3 mo. (May), 6, 1719. It was proven October 3, 1719, and is recorded in the Register\'s office at Philadelphia in Will-Book D, p. 133.\"

In the year 1896, several orphans, children of John Potts, deceased, and late of Wales, were sent over to the care of Friends in Pennsylvania. It seems very probable that they were passengers in the good ship \" William Galley,\" (Note: See page 234, ente) which brought so many Friends from the Welsh Counties of Radnor and Montgomery, and in which Thomas Potts, Junior, (Colebrookdatle), came a passenger to Pennsylvania. The JOHN POTTS is believed to be identical with John Potts, the persecuted Quaker of Llangirrig, Montgomeryshire, in Wales, of whom some account is given on pages 67 and 68, in this work. He was a brother
of Thomas Potts, (Miller), of Bristol Township, Philadelphia County.

Neither the names nor the number of all these children are given in any record so far discovered. It is, however, quite certain that John Potts and Mary Potts were two of these orphan children. The Friends of Philadelphia Monthly Meeting had the care of these children, and the Meeting minutes contain several references to them, of
which the following are copies:

\"5 mo. 26, 1699. Whereas John Austin proposed to this meeting that seveal Children of John Potts of Wales, came here last year, their passage being paid, this meeting desires Edward Shippen and Anthony Morris to Speak with the persons concerned, and see for convenient places in order that the Children be bound out apprentices by the next Orphans Court.

1 mo. 29, 1700. John Kinsey reports that there are two Orphans, Children of One John Potts to be put out, Thomas Potts also desiring (be their uncle) that this meeting would appoint some friends, to put them out to friends. John Kinsey & Anthony Morris are desired to see it done.

2 mo. 26, 1700. John Kinsey & Anthony Morris are desired to continue their care in putting out John Potts\'s Children.

11 mo. 30, 1701. Isaac Shoemaker laying before this meeting,That a friend\'s Child named Mary Potts having been with him more than two years, the time agreed is near out, and she wants learning. In order therefore that she may have what learning is suitable, he desires to have her bound with him for some longer time. Whereupon Samuel Carpenter & John Kinsey are desired to take care therein, making report thereof to the next monthly meeting.

12 mo. 27, 1702. John Kinsey & John Parsons are desired to use their endeavour to get Thomas (John) Potts\'s (NOTE: Mr. William John Potts examined these records very carefully, and was fully convinced that the name \"Thomas\" was a clerical error, written in mistake by the Clerk or transcriber, Instead of \"John.\") Child from the place where it is, upon as easy Terms as they can, in order to have it placed with a friend.

1 mo. 27, 1702. John Kinsey & John Parsons are continued to take care concerning the Child of Thomas (John) Potts, (See Note above) decease, to place it out with some honest friend. It being thought that William Rutledge\'s may be a fit place for her.

2 mo. 24, 1702. John Parsons reporting that the persons with whom the Child of Thomas (John) Potts, (See Note Above) is not willing to part with it. He and John Kinsey are desired so try a little further what they can do therein.

1 mo. 26, 1703. John Austin lays before this Meeting that John Potts, who was bound aprentice to him to learn the Carpenter\'s Trade, doth not like it, but had rather have some other emplyment, Therefore Anthony Morris (who was concerned in the binding of him) and William Hudson are desired to do what is needful in the matter,
and give an account therof to the next Monthly Meeting.

1 mo. 25, 1708. John Potts, who was an Orphan bound apprentice to John Autin by approbation of this Monthly Meeting, Complains that he hath Served out his apprenticeship, and his mistress, will not discharge him, and desires assistance. In order thereto this meeting appoints Edward Shippen, Nathan Stanbury & David Lloyd to enquire into the matter and if they find he hath severed out his time, that then they Endeavour to see him discharged, and Report their proceedings to the next Monthly Meeting.

2 mo. 29, 1708. Report they cannot understand that he hath served out his time, therefore could not discharge him.

These records make it quite certain that John Potts and Mary Potts were two of these orphan children. It is also evident that another orphan daughter was under the care of some family who were not members of the Friends meeting. In another Chapter, entitled \"Kinship of the Potts\' of Pennsylvania,\" it will be suggested who the other children are thought to be.\""

He calls himself yeoman which, from the English usage of the word, would indicate that he was a landowner. He was a resident of the Parish of Llangirrig, in Montgomeryshire, above described. His will was made in 1654, and proven in 1661, but as the inventory of his personal effects was filed in 1658 he probably died in that year. ( His will  is on file in the Consistory Court at Bangor. It is much eaten away by the decay of the paper from age and damp.)  
Some if not all the family became members of the Society of Friends. There probably was a Friends Meeting established in this vicinity, but no records are known to be in existence at this day. It is well-known that many Friends came to Pennsylvania from that section of Waltes in the latter part of the seventeenth century, and they may have carried such records as they had with them, as was sometimes done where the whole membership removed in a body.  These devoted people suffered persecution in common with those of other sections.\"

"1190","","fitzvalley","Following from Donna Sutliff (sealcorp@rtccom.net (Janes Sutliff) on sep 25, 2001:
I hope you can help me my family is Elbert, and I have traced the family back to Hugh Elbert. Can you help me I need to know were you found the information that Elenor Pierce (Woolman) married Hugh Elbert? I have looked everywhere the only thing I can find is Elinor (Bryan) Elbert, that she married a ? Bryan before she she married Hugh Elbert? This was in the Colonial Maryland of the Eastern Shore Volume 3. I have looked at the Woolman\'s and the only Woolman in Talbot, Kent, and Queen Anne was Richard Woolman, he had a son named Richard that died interstate without issure (children), unless Elenor was married to one of the other brother\'s of Richard Woolman? If you can help me I would appreciate it. This is a hard family to research because there are not a lot of Elbert\'s you do not find web pages for the Elbert as a last name, it is usually a first name.
There were a lot of Germans in Maryland in the early 1600\'s, but Hugh is not a German name it is English or Scottish. Richard Woolman was not a Quaker, in the early 1600\'s there were Quaker\'s but predominately in New Jersey, and a lot of Woolman\'s.

Following from Elsie Davis (williamrdavis@msn.com (William R Davis) on Sep 28, 2001
Mary (possibly Woolman but not proven) was Hugh\'s wife in 1693. They were living in Kent Island MD when they sold tract DOGGWOOD RIDGE located in Baltimore County on 9 August 1693 for 10,000 lbs. of tobacco. See Liber GN, folio 345-348. The deed stated Hugh was a carpenter.

I do not know if Mary was his first wife. His wife when he died in spring of 1700 was Ellenor Pierce, the widow Bryan, according to Maryland Marriages by Annie Walker Burns. At this moment I do not know where I got the maiden name Pierce but it must be in my files. It is my conclusion that Hugh\'s wife Mary was likely a Woolman and her mother was named Rebecca. Hence REBECCA\'S GARDEN tract in the family.

Hugh apparently had only one son, William, and three daughters, Mary, Sarah, and Rebecca. (Not named in his will.)

The following was transcribed from the \"Early Colonial Families of the Eastern Shore of Maryland,\" Vol. 3, by Robert Barnes.

Hugh Elbert of KI, probably from Devonshire, came to America prior to 1687 (although he is not listed in Skordas) and d. by April 1700. As Hugh Elbert (of AA Co.?), hem. by 1704 Eleanor (N), widow of (N) Bryan (Annie Walker Burns, \'Maryland Marriage References\"transcript at MHS, cites MDTP Liber \"937?\") She was left as his extx.(A}
Elinor Elbert received a payment from the estate of John Hull of TA Co. on 8 Aug 17O2iINAC 2211)

On 27 Dec 1687 Hugh Elbart patented 100 as \" Dogwood Ridge\" in BA Co (MPL 25:349, 33:71) As Hugh Elbert of KI, KE Co., carpenter, he sold this tract to William Lofton of PA Co. on 7 Aug 1693. No wife signed (BALR RM#HS:482)

As Hugh \"Elbott\" he was listed as a debtor in the 1693 inventory of John Walston of BA Co.{INAC 10:270) He was listed as Hugh Elbert \"runaway\" in the inventory (c1696) of James Phillips of BA Co (INAC 15:25, 20.225)

Hugh Elbert may be the Hugh \"Elburne\" who with Matt. Eareckson appraised the inventory of Morris Hooper on 28 May 1691.{INAC 15:120)
He may be the Hugh \'Elbery\" who received a payment from the estate of William Richards of KE Co. on 28 Jan 1697. (INAC 15,244)

Hugh Elbert d. leaving a will dated 1 March 1700, proved 23 April 1700, naming Ellinor extr, and son William. Ellinor was to take care of the children (unnamed) of the dec. The will was witnessed by Thomas and Dorothy Williamson, and George Vincent (MWB 11:8)

"1217","","fitzvalley","Information on Lars comes from Cai Mygind\'s book, \'Some
Families From the two Counties Hanherred and Hillerslev Herred
in Northern Jutland,\' pages 52 and 53.  He was born a twin (his
brother was Christian Peter Caspersen) on the tenant farm of
Kjerup parsonage.  The brothers were separated at an early age,
and Lars was brought up to about age 12 by his grandmother,
Mariane Prµtzman, at Diernesgaard.  The 1840 census for
Djernisgaard shows Lars, age 2, listed as Mariane\'s foster son
(Plejes²n).  The 1845 census lists him as her foster son and
the son of her son.
He returned at some time after 1845 to his mother and her
second husband, Lars Larsen Diernis, helping on the farm.  He
left for Lild at age 17, becoming a farmhand at the inn. The
Lild Parish Register, FHL MF 0053228, pages 85 and 86, shows
that Lars was confirmed April 8, 1852 at the T²mmerby Church
with his twin brother, Christian Peter Caspersen.  The
confirmation record lists his residence that year at age 14 as
Madsb²l in Hjardemaal Parish.
Lars was drafted in 1860, according to an undated document
written by his son, Casper L. Djernes of Clearbrook, Minnesota.
In 1861 he came home for two months, but was called back in
1862.  He was sent to Slesvig, probably along the southern
border, to fight in the 1864 war against Prussia and Austria.
He was taken prisoner during the battle at Dybboel, one of over
3,000 prisoners.  He spent two months in a prison camp at
Rendsborg, returning to northern Jutland on foot with a friend
after his release.  Lars\' military record, Record #51, Thisted
Amt, Vesterhanherred, 1864, Rigsarkivet-Kobenhavn M
Folkarkivet--12707, says that Lars was in the 9th Battalion,
3rd Company, service number 236.  When Lars returned, he found
that his stepfather had lost the farm and money in gambling and
drinking. In 1865 Lars moved with his mother and half-brother
to Glaede and then Kaeret in Lild parish.  He continued to live
with his mother even after his marriage to Maren Andersdatter
in 1868.  A child, Helene, was born in 1869, but Maren died in
1870.
Lars married Mariane Olesen in 1876; they had 12 children.
Lars made his living fishing in an open boat, and also had a
small plot of land with sheep and cows. Lars\' death date is
given as 1920 in the Mygind book, but Viola May Djernes Carter
says (1996) that it was 1925, since he nearly celebrated a
Golden Wedding anniversary with his second wife. In 1996 Gudrin
Kaspersen, wife of Gunner Kaspersen, a grandson of Lars\' twin
brother, Christian Peder Kaspersen, sent a clipping from a 1923
local newspaper in Denmark, apparently near T²mmerby.  She
translated the article as follows:  \'Twins 85 Years Old--It is
very seldom that twins reach so high an age as the brothers
ex-farmer at Tommerby Christian Kaspersen and small-holder Lars
Christian Kaspersen at Kaeret who on Sunday 25 March will be 85
years old.  Both are of good health and mind, really two fine
stout men who have worked hard throughout their lives never
giving up, and now they can look back on along life\'s good
work.  Both brothers have had many children, and it is worth
mentioning that Lars Christian Kaspersen has 8 children in
America, one of whom volunteered as an American soldier in
World War I.  Lars Christian Kaspersen himself is a veteran
from the war in 1864 between Denmark and Prussia.  The two old
twins are the eldest of six still living brothers and sister.
The others are not young either and their ages counted together
reach the high number of 470.\'"
"1218","","fitzvalley","The parish records list as witnesses at Casper\'s baptism his
uncle Erich Zacharias Prµtzman of Oddersb²l, Jens Rasmussen,
Margrethe Prµtzman, grandmother Karen Svendsdatter Norgard
(listed as Madame Casper Prµtzman of Oddersb²l) and uncle Lars
Christian from Koldkjargaard.  Kasper, as his name was recorded
in the confirmations, was confirmed in 1818 when he was 15
years old.  Cai Mygind\'s book, \'Some Families from the Two
Counties Hanherred and Hillerslev Herred in Northern Jutland\',
1972, pages 45-47, says that Casper was unmarried in the 1834
census.  He was living as tenant of Kjerup Parsonage in
T²mmerby with a housekeeper, Helene Pedersdatter, and two
farmhands.  In December 1836, Casper and Helene were married in
T²mmerby Church.  Twin boys were born in 1838, but by 1840 one
of them, Lars Christian, was living in Diernesgaard with his
grandmother, Marianne Prµtzmann.  In the 1840 census Caspar
Josva Larsen, 37, was still a leaseholder (Forpagter) at the
Kjerup Parsonage with wife Helene, 27 and son Christian, 2.
The parish minister, Frederik Christian von Haven and his wife
and child also lived there, along with three maids and two male
servants.
By the time daughter Marie was baptized in 1842, Casper
was no longer tenant of the parsonage, but lived in Rotb²lgaard
with some family.  He had bought the farm Madsb²l near the sea,
but was never able to move out there as he was seriously ill.
He spent his last days with his mother at Diernesgaard, and
died at age 39."
"1219","","fitzvalley","In the census of 1834, Helene was a housekeeper for Casper
Djernes in Kaerup parsonage.  She married him in 1836.  Twin
boys were born in 1838, but Helene and Casper sent one of their
infant twins to live with Casper\'s mother at Diernesgêard.  A
daughter was born in 1842, but by this time Casper was living
with some of his family at Rotb²lgêard.  After his death in
August of that year, Helene went to live with her own parents,
farmer Peder Thomassen and Karen Andersdatter.
In 1844 she married her brother-in-law, Lars Larsen
Djernes, and moved with him and her children to Madsb²l.  The
1845 census for Thisted, Hillerslev, Hjardemaal, Klitten, En
gaard, Madsb²ll, shows Helene with Lars and two
children--Christian, 7,  and Marie, 4, both listed as
Diµrnis--and two servants, Lars Nielsen, 18, from Hjardemaal,
and Johanne Pedersdatter, 24, from Arup.  The 1850 census shows
the family still at Madsb²ll with Lars and Helene each 38 years
old, and the children now enumerated as Lars Chr Larsen, 12,
born in T²mmerby; Sophie Marie Larsdatter, 9, born in Lild,
Caspara Larsen, 4, born in Hjardemaal and Casper Josva
Prµtzmann Larsen, 1, born in Hjardemaal.  Maren Ludvigsdatter,
10, listed as a foster daughter, born in Hjardemaal was also in
the household.  At this point I don\'t know whether or not she
was related in some way.
Helene\'s second marriage was not a happy one; Lars drank,
gambled,and did not look after his property.  Helene and Lars
had four children, but finally Helene separated from her
husband, by then known as Lars Madsb²l.  She bought a small
homestead in Kaeret, Lild about 1865, eldest son Lars Christian
and youngest son Erik joining her.  She kept house for Lars
Christian, who had become a widower after only a year of
marriage, and lived to welcome Lars\' second wife when he
married again in 1876.  Helene died alone 21 Feb 1878 when Lars
and his wife were away from home.  Lars\' daughter, little
Helene, heard strange noises from her grandmother, but by the
time she could fetch neighbors, Helene had died.The Parish
record of her death and burial refers to her as the separated
wife of Lars Larsen Djernµs."
"1220","","fitzvalley","Christian was the twin brother of Lars Christian Caspersen, was
born at Kaerup.  According to Cai Mygind\'s book, witnesses at
his baptism included Miss Hude, the vicar\'s sister-in-law, Ane
Marie Larsdatter from Diernesgard, freeholder Lars Chr. Nielsen
from Koldkjaergard, Christian Pedersen from Bjerget and
bachelor Lars Larsen Djernes. Shortly after his mother married
for the second time, Christian, about six or seven years old,
became the foster-child of his cousin, Lars Christensen
(Fuglsang), innkeeper at Bjeret, and wife Mariane Pedersdatter
Rotbol. They were good foster-parents.  The Lild Parish
Register, FHL MF 0053228, pages 85 and 86, show that Christian
and his twin brother Lars were confirmed at T²mmerby Church on
the same day, April 8, 1852, at the age of 14.  Christian\'s
residence was listed as Bjerget.  In 1854, according to Cai
Mygind, at about 16 years of age, Christian left for Thisted to
be apprenticed to a shopkeeper, as his foster father thought
there was no future in farming for him.  After his
apprenticeship, he got a job with merchant Tomas Dige at Oslos.
Dige sent him to Thorup Strand to administer a branch shop
there, including small craft trade with Norway.  Sometime
later, Christian went to Arup and opened a shop of his own.  He
met and married Ane Marie Jepsen in Arup, and their first child
was born there.  Around 1878 Christian\'s foster father sent for
him to take over Nedergard, a farm at Tommerby which Lars
Fuglsang had purchased.  Christian moved his family there, also
taking in sister Marie\' s child Karoline Thomsen.  Christian
opened a general store at one end of the farmhouse and worked
the farm at the same time with the help of a farmhand and a
maid.  Christian was too free with credit, and eventually gave
up the store, working the farm himself.  Christian and Ane
joined the growing Grundtvigian movement of free communities in
Hanherred, and in 1881 Christian founded a free school in
T²mmerby.  During World War I, he delegated the farm to his son
Kristian, and Christian and Ane moved into a little apartment
where their store had once been.  After Ane died in 1923,
Christian moved with daughter Kathrine across the street into
an old thatched house called Gammel Tuenhus.  He died there in
1928 at the age of 90."
"1221","","fitzvalley","Parish records say Marie was baptized at home 30 January 1842,
and in the church 26 June 1842 .  Witnesses were Mariane
Jensdatter from Koldkjaer, Karen Jensdatter from Bjerget, and
farmers Anders Rotb²l from Kaerup, Jens Jensen from Rotb²l, and
Svend Diernes from Lund. The following information comes from
Cai Mygind\'s book on families from Hanherred and Hillerslev
Herred, pages 58-60: Marie was born in Rotb²lgard just seven
months before her father died.   Her mother remarried when she
was two years old, and Marie grew up with four half siblings on
the farm Madsb²l in Hjardemêal Klit.  She is said to have been a
beauty, but \'a bit improvident.\'  Marie left home early to earn
a living, and by 1861 at age 19 she was a maid with Christen
Kvolsgêard at Bjerget.  In 1868 she lived at Haverslev, but the
year after returned to Lild to become a maid with her late aunt
Karoline\'s husband, Christen Jensen Vabesgêard at the farm
Myrupgard.  In 1871 she was at home with her mother and brother
at Karet and had a daughter by farmhand Niels Christian
Thomsen, who acknowledged paternity. In 1878 she had another
daughter, the father of whom was said to be farmhand Anders
Jensen from the farm Norgêard at Vust. It is said Marie and
Anders were not allowed to marry.  Marie went home to Lild with
her baby, placing her older daughter with Marie\'s brother
Christian Caspersen and family in Nedergard at T²mmerby.  The
1890 census shows her back in Myrupgard, now owned by her
cousin, Kasper Christensen Djernes Vabesgêard.  Family tradition
says Marie\'s older daughter Karoline refused a suitor, who then
turned to Marie.  In any case, Marie married widower Niels
Christian Nielsen, called Christian Sondermolle, a man 17 years
her junior, in 1895. They apparently lived happily in Lund
until Marie\'s death."
"1222","","fitzvalley","Although the Lild Parish Register records Lars\' birth, I found
no listing of witnesses for his baptism.  His confirmation was
recorded on 18 April 1830 (FHL MF 0053228, page 101). Cai
Mygind, in his book on families from Hanherred and Hillerslev
Herred, says Lars was born at Diernesgêard.  At his baptism,
Lars was held by Ingeborg Pedersdatter from Oddersb²l;
witnesses were Miss Lund of Kaerup parsonage, Jens Thomassen,
farmer from T²mmerby, Jens Christen Christensen of Rotb²lgêard
and Thomas Larsen Lund from Norklit.
Two years after Lars\' brother Casper died, Lars married
Casper\'s widow, Helene Pedersdatter, with whom he had four
children. Lars was listed as Lars Diµrnis, 31, farmer in the
1845 census at Madsb²ll.  Helene\'s children, Christian Diµrnis,
7 and Marie Diµrnis, 4 were listed, along with servants Lars
Nielsen and Johanne Pedersdatter.  In the 1850 census Lars was
still a farmer at Madsb²ll, age 38, but Lars Chr Larsen, 12 was
there instead of twin brother Christian (see notes under Helene
Pedersdatter for others in the household).
Cai Mygind says the marriage was not happy.  Lars had
become a wreckmaster, but did not look after wreckage or the
property which Helene had brought to the marriage.  He and the
schoolmaster often drank and gambled together at the inn, and
Lars lost most of the family fortune.  Lars became known as
Lars Madsb²l after the farm his brother Casper had purchased,
and on which the family lived. In about 1865 Helene separated
from Lars, and Madsb²l was sold.  Lars bought a little house
out in the sandhills where he lived \'a somewhat seedy life.\'
He sometimes lived with his daughter Mariane, who had married a
farmer in ¢sl²s, and sometimes with his other daughter, Caspara
Nielsen Dommerby in Hjardemêal Klit.  He died in Caspara\'s home
in 1891."
"1223","","fitzvalley","Cai Mygind\'s book says Caspara was the first child of Helene
Pedersdatter and Lars Larsen Djernis.  Witnesses at her baptism
were Svend Djernes\'s wife from Lund, farmers Jens Djernes from
Rotb²l, Kasper Oddersb²l and Kold Djernes from Djernes and
schoolmaster Pedersen.  She was born at Madsb²l. She was sent
from home to make a living while still young, and when she was
married at age 18 in Lild Church she was a maid with uncle
Christen Jensen Vabesgêard in Myrupgêard.  Her husband was Lars
Christian Nielsen, known as Lars Dommerby, the name of his
mother\'s second husband.  The family farmed in Hjardemêal Klit,
but husband Lars died in1899.  Caspara, known as Sara, was a
widow for 30 years and was known as Aunt Sara to the whole
family.  She and Lars had six children, three of whom emigrated
to the United States.
Caspara\'s marriage record in the Lild Parish Register
gives her age as 22.  In addition, it states she was vaccinated
August 14, 1851at Willemoes.  It refers to her as the daughter
of Helene Pedersdatter of Kjaeret, and makes no mention of
father Lars Larsen Djernes."
"1224","","fitzvalley","Most of the information about Casper comes from Cai Mygind\'s
book on families from Hanherred and Hillerslev Herred, Denmark,
pages 65-66.  Casper was born at Madsb²l.  His descendants give
his name as Casper Josuprets-Mand Larsen Djernes Madsball.
Birth and death dates were provided by Joann Reetz at the 1996
Djernes Family Reunion. Witnesses to Casper\'s baptism were Ane
Pedersdatter from ¢sl²s parsonage, Kasper Koldkjaer from Lild,
Lars Klit and Christen Blode from Klit. Casper went to ¢sl²s as
a farmhand with Jens Chr. Madsen, but left for the United
States in 1871.  He worked first in Illinois, and later went to
Nebraska, where he met and married Gurine O. Quamme in 1880 in
Hamilton County.  In 1893 the family left Nebraska where Casper
had been farming, and went to Minnesota.  They settled south of
Tyler, where they had a farm .  The family later moved into
Tyler and started a restaurant, which Casper ran until he
retired.  He died in Tyler.  He was known as Casper Larsen in
the United States.
The Danish Emigration Archives Copenhagen Police Records
show that Kasper Josva Larsen, age 23, farmer (Landman) from
Lild, Thisted, actually emigrated in 1873, registering March
31, 1873.  His destination was Chicago, Illinois, Contract
Number 1065M.  Traveling to the same place on the same day were
Lars Larsen, 22, farmer from T²mmerby, Thisted and S²ren Chr.
Lukasen, 17, farmer from T²mmerby.  Casper was apparently the
first member of the Djernes family to immigrate to the United
States.

Confirmation was in theT²mmerby Church14 April 1867, at which
time her residence was given as Kjaeret, along with her mother.

wife from Glaede and farmer Lars Klit.  Mariane left home young
to make a living, and by 1870 she was in Vabesgêard at Lund

Margrethe Larsdatter and her two sons, Jens Jensen and Niels

"1226","","fitzvalley","Erik\'s confirmation record, 8 May 1870 in the Lild Church,
states he was born at Hjardemêal Klit 17 August 1855, and
baptized 20 August.  There was apparently another baptism 10
November 1866 by a Pastor Ulrich of Hundstrup.  Erik was
vaccinated 2 July 1861.  Information on Erik comes from Cai
Mygind\'s book on families from Hanherred and Hillerslev Herred,
Denmark, pages 69-70.   Erik was born at Madsb²l.  He was
baptized in Hjardemêal Church; among the witnesses were farmers
Kasper Koldkjaer, Lars Klit, Jens Tidemannsen, Peder Ellidsb²l
and Kasper ¢ddersb²l.  In 1870 he was still at home in Lild
with his mother and half-brother Lars Christian Caspersen, but
left for Osl²s a few months later to become a farmhand. In 1871
Erik emigrated to the United States with his brother Casper.
They spent four years working on a farm in Elgin, Illinois,
then went to Nebraska in a covered wagon. They worked on a farm
near Cordova for three years.  On October 12, 1877, Erik came
to Hamilton County, Nebraska, where he had heard he could buy
railroad land cheaply.  He purchased 80 acres near Marquette,
and began to cultivate it.  In 1880 he married Maren Rasmussen,
with whom he had five children.  The Djernes farm became a
center for nieces and nephews who emigrated from Denmark to
work for board and lodging while learning to read and write
English.
The Danish Emigration Archives Copenhagen Police Records
show that Erik Zacharias Pretman Larsen, age 18, servant
(Tyende), from ¢sl²s, Thisted, actually emigrated May 18, 1874
bound for Chicago, Illinois.  His Contract Number was 1323M.
So it appears that in fact he emigrated more than a year after
his brother Casper.
The 1893 Plat Book, South Platte Precinct, shows Sakarius
Larson with 360 acres of land. His final nauralization papers
in the Hamilton County Courthouse, Aurora, Nebraska, are dated
February 9, 1888.  They state that his initial intent was filed
May 27, 1880 in District Court, Saline County, Nebraska.  Erik
was known as Zacharias Larsen in America.  His grandchild,
Vera, who, with her twin Vivian, stayed on the farm during the
first year of high school , wrote about her grandfather, \'He
would never tell us a thing.  I guess the ending of his
father\'s career and home was so bitter and sad that he did not
want us to know anything about it .  Grandfather lived a very
stern and disciplined life.  Mercenary to the point of
sometimes making life uncomfortable for the family.  But he was
a very good Christian man and known as an honest good neighbor
by all.  Every night he read in his Bible, and he loved to tell
us stories of Jesus. I was so proud how he overcame his unhappy
experiences with his father losing his land by prospering
himself and still be a good Christian man.\'
A 1936 history of Hamilton County, Nebraska by Gunnerson
gives a different view of Zacharias:  \'And their was Zacharias
Larson....It made little difference where Zach was, he was
always the life of the party.  When he and Mary, his wife, came
to retire from the farm and moved in to Marquette, he kept one
horse to furnish transportation back and forth to the farm as
the urge dictated.  When this old horse was installed in the
home in the city he refused to stay stalled.  From pure
lonesomeness he just about tore the barn down the first night.
Zach had handled worse problems than this one and he didn\'t let
this trouble him long.  He installed mrrors in the barn, both
fore and aft, and as soon as Old Dobbin saw himself surrounded
by other of his kind, all the trouble was over.  It was not
long after this that the motor industry came out with rear
vision mirrors in their cars.  Whether they stole his idea or
he collected royalty on it, I never learned.\' Zacharias and
wife Maren had five children, only two of whom survived to
adulthood.
Zach\'s obituary appeared in the Aurora News, Aurora,
Nebraska, July 14, 1933:
\"Burial Rites for Marquette Pioneer
Erik Zakarias Pritsman Larsen Djernes was born in Thy
Denmark, August 17, 1885 [obviously an error].  He emigrated to
this country in 1871 and came to Barington, Illinois
[Barrington, Illinois is just north of Chicago in Cook and Lake
counties].  In 1874 he drove to Nebraska in a covered wagon and
stayed at Friend [Saline county] Nebraska.  In 1879 he moved to
Hamilton county and bought a farm.  In 1882 he was united in
marriage to Maren Rasmussen.  To this union was born 5 children
and 3 boys and 2 girls.  Two girls and one boy died in infancy.
This wife preceded hm in death February 17, 1907.  In the

in Marquette where he has lived until he passed away.
On July 5th he suffered a stroke and passed away July 7th
at the age of 77 years and 20 days.  He was baptized and
confirmed in the faith of the Lutheran church in Denmark.
After coming to Hamilton county he joined the Lutheran church
at Kronberg and was a faithful member.

\'Frances Williams\'
Siebold Plantain Lily

The species is named for the German physician & botanist Philipp Franz von Siebold (1796‚1866) who sparked general interest in hostals in the early 1800s after he returned to the Netherlands with several specimens he had collected over time during his long stint as a physician in Nagasaki for the Dutch East India Company.

The cultivar is named for Mrs. Frances Ropes Williams (1883-1969) of Winchester Massachusetts, who spotted & quickly obtained the first known specimen when it appeared in a field of H. sieboldiana at Bristol Nurseries in Connecticutt, in 1936.

Mrs. Williams was a devoted hosta enthusiast & founding member of the American Hosta Society; she bred & named many introductions developed in her private garden."

Garden nestled among buildings is hidden treasure

October 5, 1994

Renovations have recently been completed on the President\'s Court, a collection of hosta plants and other greenery nestled in the enclosure surrounded by Buildings 3, 10. 11 and 13.

Eighty percent of the concrete walkways surrounding the square garden have just been repaired. A dirt path that went through the garden from one corner to the other has also been replaced with a blue stone walkway.

The garden is home to at least 10 different types of hosta plants, identifiable by their large tropical-looking leaves. They were a gift from Frances Ropes Williams, a 1904 MIT graduate and avid gardener. According to Norman Magnuson, route supervisor in grounds services, she bred different types of the plants she enjoyed and named them in memory of her sister, Constance Williams Hosta."

An eight-sided \"polygonal\" barn and a swine barn on New Hope Farm, owned by Harlan Nelsen near Mission Hill, were recently nominated to the National Register of Historic Places for their historic and physical integrity. 

Nelsen said he asked about having the barns on his century-old farm listed on the Register several months ago. 

\"My great-grandfather, Norman Nelsen, was a meticulous record-keeper and kept the farm the same way,\" said Harlan Nelsen. 

Nelsen is the third generation to live on the farmstead. He said the eight-sided storage barn was built for $1,325 in 1913 as his great-grandfather was establishing the farmstead. The farm was purchased by the senior Nelsen in 1901. 

The storage barn is approximately 40 feet in diameter, and each side measures about16 feet wide. There is an entry point in every other side of the barn, he said. 

It was built as a machine shed, but since the equipment has gotten larger with modern technology, Nelsen said he now can only store smaller equipment inside. 

However, despite its size, there are other advantages to having a building like this on your property. 

\"These buildings are built with such better lumber than what you could ever buy today,\" Nelsen added. 

A second building at New Hope Farm was also listed on the registry. A hog barn, which Nelsen said hasn\'t held hogs in many years, is unique because of its gambrel roof. The extended roof area, complete with a cupola, served as a hay loft for feeding the animals below, Nelsen said. 

Nelsen said he has removed several buildings from the farm site since he retired from the military and returned to Mission Hill to farm in 1979. 

According to Steve Rogers, Historic Preservation Coordinator in Pierre, it is unusual to have individual buildings nominated and not the entire farmstead. 

Polygonal barns are very rare in South Dakota, Rogers said. 

\"Less than 40 barns of this type were ever constructed in South Dakota, and there are less than 30 remaining today,\" Rogers said. 

\"Generally, we look at the entire site and try to create an association between the community and the farm itself. But these buildings had such historic and physical integrity, there was no question they should be nominated,\" Rogers said. 

The building needs to retain an association between the setting, materials with which it was built, the craftsmanship and how they all come together. And the buildings must be old enough to meet the general guidelines. 

\"Most of the historic registry contains structures which are at least 50 years old. If they aren\'t 50 years old, they have to have extraordinary qualities which would qualify them for another reason,\" Rogers said. 

\"Some people think being listed on the National Historic Registry restricts them from making changes to the structure, so they don\'t even attempt to see if would meet the criteria,\" Rogers said. 

\"The nomination is really an Œhonoriffic designation\' to celebrate the historic qualities in a structure,\" he added.

LEAHEY, MICHAEL I.

LEAHEY-Michael I., 46. Of Irvington, NY, formerly of Nyack, NY, suddenly on January 30, 2003. Founder and Director of Clinical Trials at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, past Director of the Office of Cardiac Research at Columbia Presbyterian. Beloved husband of Lynn (nee Davey), loving father of James Patrick and Katherine Michaela. Beloved son of Edward B. Leahey Sr., MD and Mary (nee Carlin) Leahey. Beloved brother of Mimi Leahey Nangle, Anne Leahey, Frances Leahey, Patricia Meriam, the late Joseph Leahey and the late Edward B. Leahey Jr., MD. Cherished uncle of 15 nieces and nephews. Funeral services Monday 10 am, Church of St. Barnabas, N. Broadway, Irvington, NY.

Leahey, Jr. Foundation, 156 Strawtown Road, West Nyack, New York 10994.

LEAHEY-Michael I. The members of The Office of Clinical Trials at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center mourn the sudden and tragic passing of our Director Michael I. Leahey. He was a visionary leader who helped create the first centralized Office of Clinical Trials at an academic medical center over a decade ago. This was a uniquely successful joint venture between The New York Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University. Its outstanding success is due in large measure to Michael\'s passion for the importance of clinical research and for his absolute insistance that clinical research be conducted with the highest ethical and scientific integerity. In addition, he possessed a remarkable business acumen that allowed him to build an extraordinarily successful enterprise in a very short period of time. Michael built the first and he built the best. The Office is considered a model nationally and internationally and its reputation reflects great credit on Michael and on The Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Visitors from virtually all of the major Academic Medical Centers in the U.S., came to New York to get a first hand tour of the Office Michael built and nurtured. He was generous to all, freely sharing his time and his ideas with anyone who asked. The Office has become the catalyst for the explosive growth of clinical research here over the past decade. Scores of clinical investigators on our campus obtained their first support for their research ideas from funds generated by the Office of Clinical Trials. He was a dedicated mentor to his coworkers and to the faculty and staff and he took great pride in the accomplishments of others. At the same time, Michael was a man of many other interests. He enjoyed life to the fullest. He was a published author and his third mystery novel was completed just before his untimely death. He was totally dedicated to his wife, Lynn and their two children, Jack and Kate. The Office of Clinical Trials Columbia University New York Presbyterian Hospital Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center

LEAHEY - Michael. The boards, faculty, students and staff of Columbia University Health Sciences Division and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital mourn the tragic loss of our friend and colleague, Michael Leahey. Mike was the director of the Office of Clinical Trials at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, the only person to hold the position after being appointed in 1992. In addition, he oversaw the Clinical Trials Fund, a multi-million dollar fund that invests in the support of programs and projects related to clinical research activities. Mike first joined Columbia in the mid-1980\'s, serving as administrator for the Division of Cardiology and later as business manager for the Department of Medicine. He was a man of many talents, and published two novels, Broken Machines (2000) and The Pale Green Horse (2001). He recently completed a third novel, Back in the U.S.S.R., which has been submitted for publication. Mike brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to every position he held and the deep loss we feel at his passing is a testament to the mark he leaves on this institution. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Lynn, his children, Katie and Jack, his family and friends. Gerald D. Fischbach, M.D. Executive Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Columbia University Herbert Pardes, M.D. President and CEO NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital

LEAHEY-Michael. The Department of Medicine of the Columbia University College of Physicans and Surgeons mourns the untimely death of Mr. Michael Leahey. A long time friend of the department, Mr. Leahey had brought brilliance, innovation, and dedication to develop a superior Clinical Trials Program. His remarkable successes were crucial to our academic endeavor and to the welfare of patients. We miss him as a friend and extend our sympathies to his family.

   At that time he also left his sister, Martha, his picture in a gold frame.

Martin, because he was named for his grandmother, Martha.  After Ole
Fuglestad\'s own son died, he wanted to adopt someone in his place.  He chose a
son of his youngest sister, Aagot, who lived at Lode in Narbo.  This boy was
very intelligent but very quick tempered and eccentric.  His name apparantly
was Aadne.  He was so incorrigible that Ole F. had to sen him home again.
Because of Aadne, Mrs. F. also seemed to hold a grudge against all of Ole`s
relatives.  Pa thought that was why Ole wrote secretly to Pa\'s father, Helge,
about some money hidden under the kitchen floor.  Thus Aadne lode was
responsible for the loss of some inheritance by Pa\'s father, uncles and aunts.

BURIAL: Hallvard Aanestad sent a photograph of \"Varhaug Old Cemetery\" showing
        three iron crosses in the cemetery.  It is believed that Helge Olson
        is buried near these iron crosses.
NOTES: Ralph Aanestad states that he acquired information directly from his
grandfather, Helge Aanestad, son of Helge Olson Aanestad.
Ralph Aanestad\'s record shows spelling as Helge Olsen Aanestad vs. the NLR#70
which spells it Helge Olson Aanestad.  Ralph lists Helge Olson\'s wife as Anna
Malene while the NLR lists it as Anna Malena Knutsdotter.
He was a klokker in the church in Varhaug for many years.
(A-020-U) Handwritten by Alert Palmer Aanestd, states, \"Pa\'s father was Helje
Olsen Aanestad.  Fuglestad\" (this is Ole Fuglestad who was Helge Olsen\'s
brother-in-law) \"wrote him (Helge Olsen) a letter a few years before he died,
not to be opened till after his death, in which he ennumerated his property.
   At that time he also left his sister, Martha, his picture in a gold frame.
She later gave this picture to her son, Ole.  Ole gave it to Pa\'s brother,
Martin, because he was named for his grandmother, Martha.  After Ole
Fuglestad\'s own son died, he wanted to adopt someone in his place.  He chose a
son of his youngest sister, Aagot, who lived at Lode in Narbo.  This boy was
very intelligent but very quick tempered and eccentric.  His name apparantly
was Aadne.  He was so incorrigible that Ole F. had to sen him home again.
Because of Aadne, Mrs. F. also seemed to hold a grudge against all of Ole`s
relatives.  Pa thought that was why Ole wrote secretly to Pa\'s father, Helge,
about some money hidden under the kitchen floor.  Thus Aadne lode was
responsible for the loss of some inheritance by Pa\'s father, uncles and aunts.
Later, Aadne became a teacher.  He died poor after a hectic life.\"
A-020-U is not clear but seems to indicate that each heir (of Ole Fuglestad?)
        got 414 speuidollars (spelling?) with the reult that Helge built a house
        and barn on his farm.
A-020-N lists name Helge Olson Aanestad, Varhaug, Norway.  b. 1807, d. 1876.

A-020-R From Alert Palmer Aanestad, my thoughts 3-17-1975.  \"The way I piece it
        together from Salina\'s report of the trip to Norway in 1928, where she
        tells of the visit to Waals in Sandevar, south of Kingsberg.  But the
        name of those living on the place, she gives as Hvambaal which leaves
        me a little unclear.  It looks like this -
          Martin Aanestad, Pa\'s brother, married a wife in Sandevar and,
        perhaps she was a Waal.  Then the farm was Waal?  Their daughter,
        Malina, our cousin, married Karl Hvambaal.  She had died in 1915.  Karl
        Hvambaal was 72 in 1928 and Selina describes him as a young looking old
        man.  Three of Karl and Malina\'s children lived on the farm.   Halvor
        operated the farm.  Peder worked in a bank near by.  Sophie kept house.
        Gina was married and lived nearby.  Another sister worked in Honefuns
        (spelling).  The old grandmother living with them was 80 in 1928.  That
        would be Martin\'s wife, the mother of Malena.  Selina does not mention

BURIAL: Hallvard Aanestad sent a photograph of \"Varhaug Old Cemetery\" showing
        three iron crosses in the cemetery.  It is believed that Helge Olson
        is buried near these iron crosses.
NOTES: Ralph Aanestad states that he acquired information directly from his
grandfather, Helge Aanestad, son of Helge Olson Aanestad.
Ralph Aanestad\'s record shows spelling as Helge Olsen Aanestad vs. the NLR#70
which spells it Helge Olson Aanestad.  Ralph lists Helge Olson\'s wife as Anna
Malene while the NLR lists it as Anna Malena Knutsdotter.
He was a klokker in the church in Varhaug for many years.
(A-020-U) Handwritten by Alert Palmer Aanestd, states, \"Pa\'s father was Helje
Olsen Aanestad.  Fuglestad\" (this is Ole Fuglestad who was Helge Olsen\'s
brother-in-law) \"wrote him (Helge Olsen) a letter a few years before he died,
not to be opened till after his death, in which he ennumerated his property.
   At that time he also left his sister, Martha, his picture in a gold frame.
She later gave this picture to her son, Ole.  Ole gave it to Pa\'s brother,
Martin, because he was named for his grandmother, Martha.  After Ole
Fuglestad\'s own son died, he wanted to adopt someone in his place.  He chose a
son of his youngest sister, Aagot, who lived at Lode in Narbo.  This boy was
very intelligent but very quick tempered and eccentric.  His name apparantly
was Aadne.  He was so incorrigible that Ole F. had to sen him home again.
Because of Aadne, Mrs. F. also seemed to hold a grudge against all of Ole`s
relatives.  Pa thought that was why Ole wrote secretly to Pa\'s father, Helge,
about some money hidden under the kitchen floor.  Thus Aadne lode was
responsible for the loss of some inheritance by Pa\'s father, uncles and aunts.
Later, Aadne became a teacher.  He died poor after a hectic life.\"
A-020-U is not clear but seems to indicate that each heir (of Ole Fuglestad?)
        got 414 speuidollars (spelling?) with the reult that Helge built a house
        and barn on his farm.

A-020-R From Alert Palmer Aanestad, my thoughts 3-17-1975.  \"The way I piece it
        together from Salina\'s report of the trip to Norway in 1928, where she
        tells of the visit to Waals in Sandevar, south of Kingsberg.  But the
        name of those living on the place, she gives as Hvambaal which leaves
        me a little unclear.  It looks like this -
          Martin Aanestad, Pa\'s brother, married a wife in Sandevar and,
        perhaps she was a Waal.  Then the farm was Waal?  Their daughter,
        Malina, our cousin, married Karl Hvambaal.  She had died in 1915.  Karl
        Hvambaal was 72 in 1928 and Selina describes him as a young looking old
        man.  Three of Karl and Malina\'s children lived on the farm.   Halvor
        operated the farm.  Peder worked in a bank near by.  Sophie kept house.
        Gina was married and lived nearby.  Another sister worked in Honefuns
        (spelling).  The old grandmother living with them was 80 in 1928.  That

         Sammie Lang (A-011) explains that all the brothers and sisters took on
         the name Gunderson except for Raghnild, who kept the last name,
         Korsgaard.  Also that she was called \"Rachel\" in America.
         Perhaps the answer comes from a letter (SO: A-014) dated 3-24-90 from
         Walter F. Kelley, who explains the reason for the name, Korsgaard, was
         that her father married Kari Korsgaard, who was an only child.  She
         inherited the Korsgaard Farm and Ragnhild thus acquired the name.

       of the Numedal Valley is the town of Rodberg which is not far from the
       farm [Korsgarad] where her family lived.  The farm is now owned by the
       Bergs.  Ragnhild was baptized in the stave church at the little town of
       Nore which is in the Numedal area.\")
       PROBLEM: A-020-O says all Ragnhild\'s brothers and sisters were born at
               Nore. Norway.  A-020-M says all born at Nummedal.               Nordahl Skarshaug lists Jorund\'s b. place a Uvdal, Norway.
EDUCATION: In Norway (From A-014)
RELIGION: Lutheran.
NOTES: Solveig Thorstenson relates that Ragnhild immigrated to America with her
       father, Gunulf Knutson Bekkeseth, (Sammie Lang believes the name
       should be, Gunull Svenson, and that his name was Americanized to
       Gunder, and that Gunder, Iowa is named for him) who was a widower,
       (also see Notes for Gunnel Svenson-497)
       and her brothers and sisters in 1862 when she was 10 years of age.
       Walter Kelley (SO: A-014) states that his mother Henrietta gave him
       information in 1932 for a college paper and gave the emmigration date
       as 1865.  A-014 indicates that Ragnhild lived in Clayton Co., Iowa until
       1879, Filmore Co., Minnesota until 1884, and Luverne, Minn. until 1885.
Ralph Aaanestad relates, \"Grandmother Ragnhild could bake the best rye bread in
the entire Minnehaha County area in my estimation and she always had some on
hand when I brought her a load of corn cobs for the kitchen stove or some oats
and corn for her chickens.  She told me she was born in Numdal, Norway, on Feb
16, 1852.  Numdal is about 100 miles northeast of Stavanger.  Grandmother cameto America when she was nearly 15 years old.  She spent 18 years on the home
place where Wilson F. Kelley lived for many years.  In early days she used to
twist flax straw for fuel in the family stove and she had a small flock of
chickens on hand from earliest days of marriage until her death in 1933.  Yes,
some of those chickens had names and they were afraid of anyone other than
Grandmother.  She also used to choip up small kindling for her kitchen stove
and I have her small, very sharp axe used for this chore.  Grandmother managed
many duties around the parsonage and farm, for the family was engaged in
farming along with the pasoral duties of Grandfather.  Ragnhild was a hard
worker all her days until the last year or twwo when her health began to fail
her.  She told me that at one time she could have made a return trip to Norway
but turned it down for it took 3 months to come over on a boat when she
emigrated to the United States and she didn\'t want any more of that.  She was
the mother of 9 children, five boys and four girls, all of whom survived her.
She was very happy when her children were present for her Golden Wedding in
1926.\"
A-020-O.  Henrietta relates that when her grandfather and children came to the
U.S. her mother, Ragnhild, \"was 13 years old.  She had to find a home, to work
and support herself and help the younger ones.  Hers has been a life of
sacrifice and no complaint.\"
A-020-f tells she came to U.S. with father and family March 1866.  Lived in
Clayton co., Iowa, Fillmore  MN, Luvern  MN, Sherman SD.  Died at Sherman of a
cerebral hemorrage.
A-031 lists her sir name as Korsgaarden, same as for her father.
A-044 a letter written by her husband, Helge, indicates her illness began with
a light stroke which incapacitated her memory and usual busy lifestyle and after
7 months death seperated them.  Helge describes the funural service and some of
his feelings.  He spells her name, Ragnil, in the letter."

            He taught school and was a church singing leader in Olmsted County,
            1899-00.  From 1900-1905 he farmed and carried mail at Sherman, S.D.
            A-042 shows him as pastor of the English Lutheran Congregation in
            Cottonwood, MN, 1904-05.  A-042 lists the names and history of the
            various churches he served.
            From Milton Hackett we read, \"Anna and Helge\'s first home was at
            Sherman, where oldest child Ditlif was born.  From there they moved
            to Cottonwood where Anna lived while Helge attended Luther Seminary
            at St. Paul.  Three children were born meanwhile: Gerald, Wilhelm,
            and Ragnvald.  Helge was ordained into the ministry in 1908 and was
            called to Carpio, N.D.  They were in Carpio for 5 years: son Orwoll
            was born there.  In 1913 the family moved to Esmond, N.D. where
            Helge became pastor in response to the Esmond call.  He served
            three congregations: Trinity (in town), Emanual and St. Olaf.  In
            Esmond were born Solveig Lois, Harald, and Alf.  The retirement
            years, beginning in 1947, were spent in St. Paul (at 2343 Carter
            Ave.).  Their home, near daughter Lois and son-in-law Woody
            Thorstenson remained a haven for the family members and a gathering
            place for the clan.\"  (ORWOLL DOC \'A\')
            He was Pres. of Northwestern College Corporation, 1913-1914.
            Helge was Secretary of the N.D. District of the Evangelical
            Lutheran Church and witnessed the merger of the Norse-speaking
            Lutheran congregations in 1917, the merger in 1942 of the
            Evangelical Lutheran Church, and as Emeritus Pastor, the merger
            forming the American Lutheran Church.
In the 1900 Federal census he is listed, with his parents on the farm at
Sherman, SD, single and working on the farm.  In A-020-V he tells that he
thinks the family (then Hege, Raghnild, Helge, Alma, Carl, Henrietta and
Walter) moved to Sherman the fall of 1886.  The Rosendal Church was just
west of the Ostedal place.  That building blew down and the new church was
built 1/2 mile east of their home.  While the church was being built,
services were held in the 2nd floor of the parsonage (the early home known
by Alert Palmer Aanestad).  Then mentions the Rosendal
congregation, the size (no details), the split.  He tells that his grandfather,
(Gunul), came to the U.S. with his family, but when asked about the name,
Gunhild Bekkeset, Helge does not know that name.  Helge says he was born at the
Skarshaug\'s place (Groth place?) east of Clermont.  Mentions that he believed
Holstein Groth went to Elgin to trade, but that we (Helge) knew Clermont best.
Says he (Helge) was born in Clayton Co., about 4 miles east of Clermont.   When
Helge, Clara and Carl were kids they lived near Clermont.  When their father
went to the semenery, they lived near Lansbobro, MN.  When they later moved
west in 1884, the got on the train at Lansbobro.  Speaks of visits to
Skarhaug\'s when kids. Mentions a play threshing machine.  Goes on to tell of
living at Lansboro, the move to Laverne, the call to Rosendal and the first day
of school.  Helge mentions something about an injured heel made by Rev. Turmo.
No details given but mention is made of visiting Skarshaugs, Langs (when Alert
Palmer Aanestad) was a small child, the Enersons (Enen and Tom, who had 1 son
and 5 daughters).  Names the children: Theodore, Minnie, Alma, Julia, Stina,
Nora.  Thinks Nora had written to Lois Thorstenson at one time and was living
in Austin, MN and might be a good source about \"Faster\" and the Bekkeset line."

           Dakota.  An interesting finding from the 1900 census (CA-001 and

OCCUPATION: Farmer, practical nurse, postmistress.
NOTES:  (CA-002) 1900 census shows Sara Dahl living on a farm (mortgaged) in
        Lyon Co., Lucas Twp., Minnesota.  She was widowed; her occupation was
        given as housekeeper.  The first 5 of her 7 children listed `at school\'
        for occupation.  Alma Aanestad, sister of Helge Martinus Aanestad, is
        shown living as a boarder with Sara and teaching school.
        From Milton Hackett comes the following information . . .
        Became a widow at the age of 34 and was left with 6 children, Anna
        being the oldest.  She served as Postmistress in Cottonwood for many
        years and received a certificate signed by Presidents Taft and
        Theodore Roosevelt.  Sarah was 9 years old when she moved with her
        family to western Minnesota where they settled on a homestead.
        At 18 years of age she married Hans Christian (Christian H.) Dahl
        and they lived on his homestead, west of what is now Cottonwood.
        The first schoolhouse for the area was built on their farm.  At there
        on November 18, 1888 was organized what is now the English Lutheran
        Church of Cottonwood and Christian was the first treasurer.  They
        donated land from their homestead to the church for a cemetery.
        After Christian died she farmed for about 10 years, dividing her
        time between town and the farm, then moved permanently to town
        so that her children could have the advantage of the town schools.

       Hib and Ada: Sylvia in 1917 and June in 1919.  Hib had a fine tenor
       voice and after the Seminary went to Milan, Italy to study voice and
       prepare for a career in opera.  However, a career in opera eluded him
       and he spent his life as a teacher of voice and a coach, dividing his

MARRIAGE: Married his childhood sweetheart, Helen Bly.
OCCUPATION: Chiropracter.
NOTES: At age 22, he and Helen moved to Davenport, Iowa and both studied to
       become chiropracters.  Their first child was born the following year.
       In 1917 Dr. Dahl began his first chiropactic practice, in Cottonwood,
       and was occassionally assisted by his wife, Dr. Helen Dahl.  In addition
       to involvement in civic affairs, he was a good athelete and played
       baseball and also was an acomplished golfer.  His interest in music led
       him to sing in the Lutheran church choir and  direct the town band for
       many years.  During the depression, patients could no longer pay a set
       fee for services and Clarence continued to help his clients for a
       reduced, fee and in many cases, no fee at all.  To manage during these
       times he opened a second office one or two nights a week in Granite
       Falls but even so the house had to be sold and the family moved into
       rented quarters.  Somehow, during this time he managed to scrape up
       enough money to send Syble to college.  In March, 1934, at the request
       of some citizens of Canby, Clarence moved to Canby and prospects for the
       future were bright.  But on April 16, 1936, at the age of 46, Clarence
       suddenly died from a heart attach.  In Cottonwood, where Clarence was
       a fovorite son, his obituary captured their feeling: \"it can truly be
       said of Dr. Dahl - here was a noble man.  His passing is a great loss\".
       Helen remarried to Neil Kise, a recent widower and family friend.  She
       returned to Cottonwood where son Curtis completed his schooling and
       took up his life\'s residence.  Niel died in 1943.  Helen lived on to
       age 90 and is buried beside Clarence. (ORWOLL DOC \'A\')

       various ways:
       AARVOLL, AARVOLD, ARVAL; also shown in the early days in Wisconsin as

       Melas (who had emigrated in 1844) to America and settled in Dane
       County, Wisconsin.  It seems likely they stayed with relatives or

       miles southeast of Madison.  It is not know whether they traveled
       together or arrived in Wisconsin seperately but their marriage is       recorded at the West Koshkonong Church as: Sylfest Lasseson Orwoll and

       there is the birth of their first child, Lars, on October 19, 1852

NOTES: From D-010 \"Early Memories\", written by Herman Hans Dahl-492, we read,
        \"The Hans P. Dahl (Hans Pederson Oksendal-482) family immigrated from
         Norway, sailing from Stavanger in the spring of 1867.  We came over on
         a sailing vessels called \'Aurania\' and were seven weeks on the ocean,
         (D-015 Nils tells that his mother had to have provisions for the
         entire trip which consisted mainly of flatbrod, dravle, gumme og smor)
         finally landing in Quebec.\"  (Herman Hans was 1 year old, the
         youngest of seven children, his father, Hans P. was 52 years old and
         his mother, Anna was 43).  \"From Quebec we took a small steamer and
         went up the St. Lawrence river to Buffalo, New York.  From there we
         were transferred over onto a cattle boat and went on this cattle
         boat for some distance when were transferred to a freight train.  All
         of our luggage, as well as the people, were just shoved onto box cars
         and taken to Detroit.  From Detroit we took a steamer across Lake
         Michigan to Milwaukee, and from Milwaukee we took the train to Eau
         Claire, arriving there about June 1867.  We stayed at Niels T. Dahl
         (Nils Tobias Dahl-1293) House (Dunn County, Wisconsin) for awhile
         until we had a chance to build a log house on eighty acres that father
         intended to homestead.  This eighty acres was nothing but brush land,
         hills, etc. and was not worth very much, but we lived there for two
         years.\"  \"After two years (1869) we moved to Blue Earth County, Medo
         Post Office.  There we rented a farm from a fellow by the name of
         Henry Nash.  This we farmed for two years.\"  \"The last harvest we had
         we were hauling grain from a field over home to the grainary and Nels
         and I were sitting on the wagon.  Nels was sitting on the front and on
         the road home he fell down from the wagon and the wagon wheel went
         over one of his legs.  It was the fall before we were going to move to
         Cottonwood.  He was laid up with his leg for a long time.\"
         (D-015 Nils tells of the wagon going over his leg and stomach while
         the family was moving from Wisc. to Minn.  \"I can remember as well as
         if it had been now, all that took place; how father came and picked
         me up in his arms and prayed aloud for me.  The most remarkable thing
         about that accident was that I never felt any evil effects in my
         stomach from it - just a little soreness on the outside the first days
         and it was not very long until I could walk on my leg.\")
             D-010 \"While we were there a bunch of boys came from Coon Prairie,
         Wisconsin, and were going out west to look for homesteads.  They
         stopped  at our place and Ole (Ole H. Dahl-488, brother of Herman)
         decided to go with them.  The names of the boys were Ole Dahl, George
         Anderson, Edward Hamre, Peder Eliason, and Soren Aigness.\"
                D-010 continues to describe how the boys laid claim to their
         homesteads, a quarter section for each boy plus a quarter section
         adjoining for his father.  And so the Hans P. Dahl family moved their
         belongings to Cottonwood in 1871, just a short time after the Indian
         Massacre  along the Minnesota River.  They spent the first winter in
         Ingebret Kolhei\'s little log house on his claim until the next spring.
         The Dahl homestead was the east half of 6-113-41 Lyon County,
         Minnesota.
                D-011 states that Hans Dahl-482 lived on the Der Framme Gaard
         (the farm in Oksendal tied to the \'Legend of The Two Hirdemand\') prior
         to emmigrating to America.
                D-012 states that Ole Dahl, his father Hans and his brother
         Christian all had homsteads in a row.  D-011 reveals that Nils Dahl
         later bought the NE1/4 of Sec. 8, which borders up against Cottonwood
         Lake, from Soren Aigness, who D-012 says went back to Wisconsin.  Nils
         traveled from Pemberton to Cottonwood in three covered wagons, taking
         his family, machinery, cattle and belongings there over a period of
         one week.  Beause he had already used his homestead rights, Nils now
         used his tree claim rights.  Minnesota was offering free land to those
         who would plant a percent of their acerage to trees and so Nils
         planted Maples and Cottonwood trees.
                D-015 says that when the family still lived in Norway, they
         traveled to the nearest town, Flekkefjord by rowboat.  Hans would make
         barrel or keg staves and take them to Flekkefjord to sell.  Nils-491
         had the draw knife that his father had used to make the staves which
         were used to make barrels for fish packing containers.  Nils planned
         to give the knife to Hartvig, who also had made staves in town."

       Bergen Church, (the present Bergen Curch was built later, in 1909 and
       1910 while Rev. Dahl was still pastor).
pastor).        A great deal could be said about the long and
       consecrated service of Pastor Dahl.  By his loving disposition, his
       quiet and unassuming manner, his faith in God and man, he won his way
       into the hearts of his parishoners.  Pastor and Mrs. Dahl were faithful
       doctor\'s helpers during many an illness, and remembered particularly was
       a diptheria epidemic when they swabbed throats in many homes.  The
       pastor\'s  pay often consisted of hay and oats for the horses, produce,
       half a hog or beef; likely no set salary was ever agreed on.  All
       transportation was by foot, horseback or horse and buggy.  The earlier
       roads were nothing more or less than a trail through the long prairie
       grass.  In the rainy season, they became a mass of sticky gumbo that
       gummed the wheels, making it necessary for him to stop along the way to
       clean the spokes of the wheels.  Often, when he came by sled, his
       whiskers and fur coat glistened with long icicles which delighted the
       children.  In 1916 he purchased his first car, a Model T Ford from
       George Mortenson, which he often found more difficult to handle than the
       horses.\"   D-030 goes on to reveal that the Rev. P.H. Dahl, his wife - a
       stately and capable woman - and three children Anna, Hans and Inga,
       arrived in late 1881.  Louise, better known as Lula, and Sandre were
       born in the original parsonage south of the tracks and in 1885 the family
       moved to the new parsonage, where Alice, Wilhem, Randolph, Margaret,
       Constance, and Helga were born -- also Herbert and Roland, who died in
       infancy.  In spite of having no modern conveniences, Mrs. Dahl was
       always a dignified and charming hostess and performed well her duties as
       `preste frue\' and mother.  Teachers often roomed and boarded at Pastor
       Dahl\'s home."

A-020-d. Gives a History of Bekkeset (the farm).  See A-020-d for more
         information on the owners of Bekkeset.  Following is the information
         useful to our genealogy:
         The gaard (farm) Bekkeset begins in 1813 with the division of the
         farm into south and north parts.
         In the Early 1830\'s the renter was Sven Gunnulsen and family.
         Sven married Gunhild Nelsdotter in 1814.  Their 1st child, Gunul
         was born in 1815.  A second child, Ragnhild, was born about 1834
         (probably incorrect if she was 43 in 1865.  Her birthdate would
          more likely be about 1822).  A 3rd child, Gunhild, was born
         (date not known).  Our earliest known relative at Bekkaset begins in:
               1834 - a tax list shows Gunel Svennsen at Bekkeset.  He would be
                      19 years old.  He is shown as a renter from the owner of
                      Bekkeset, Torstein Stenersen.
               1835 - a census shows a family of 8 at Bekkeset. Names not given
               1838 - a land registry still shows Sven Gunnelson as operator of
                      the farm.
               1843 - Gunul and Kari get married and move to her family farm,
                      Korsgaard.
               1845 - Hans Nilsen is the farm operator.
               1846 - Hans marries Gunul\'s sister, Ragnhild (she would be about
                      24 years old)
               1858 - Svenn, father of Gunul dies.  82 years old.
               1865 - Census shows Hans Nilsen 43, wife Ragnil 43, and 6
                      children at Bekkeset.  Also Gunul\'s mother, Gunhild, was
                      living there.
               1866 - Gunul\'s mother, Gunhild dies.  Age 82.
                      This is the year Gunul and his family come to the U.S.
               1901 - Hans Nilsen transferred the farm to his son, Halvor
                      Hansen.
               1912 - Hans Nilsen died.  Age 91.
               1920 - Halvor Hansen gets married.  There were no children.
               1938 - Halvor Hanson\'s wife dies.  Age 61.  Halvor clears up a
                      longstanding irregularity to the title of the farm and
                      soon after sells farm to Nils Torstensen of North
                      Bekkeset, who still owned the farm as of 1963.
                      Halvor retained lifelong rights to live on the farm.
               1941 - Halvor died.  Age 73.

NOTES: Kenneth Ernest Schilling (7. Selma4, 5.Hans3, 2.Hans2, 1 .Peder1) b. 1913-07-09, St. Paul, Ramsey Co, MN, occupation Schoolteacher (English), m. 1935-07-12, in Westfield, Chautauqua Co, NY, Florence Cecelia Randall, b 1914-02-27, Cleveland, Cuyahoga Co, OH, (daughter of George Henry Randall and Della Eliza Benson) occupation Homemaker, d. 1986-03-11, Clearwater, Pinellas Co, FL, buried: Ridge Hill Memorial Park, Lorain, OH. Kenneth died 1997-12-24, Elyria, Lorain Co, OH, buried: Ridge Hill Memorial Park, Lorain, OH Adopted by Ernest A Schilling and Selma Mw-tine DahI Schilling on 1925-09-04, with the consent of his mother Marguerite Kean. Kenneth had lived with Ernest and Selma since 1913-07-25, when he was only two weeks old, Kenneth\'s birth name was Kenneth Earnest Thompson. In the adoption, his name was changed to Kenneth Ernest Schilling.

 The story about Selma Martine Dahl and Ernest Adolph Schilling is rather interesting.  Before Ernest married Selma, he was married to a woman name Alice Louise Bunce.  They had a daughter, Marguerite Mary Schilling.  When Marguerite was very young, Ernest and Alice divorced and he married Selma.  Now, when Mary was still a teenager, she became pregnant by an \"Unknown\" Thompson, and gave birth to a son, Kenneth Ernest Thompson.  Since she was still living with Ernest and Selma, and since \"Unknown\" Thompson disappeared, she decided to let Ernest and Selma adopt her baby, changing the baby\'s name from Kenneth Ernest Thompson to Kenneth Ernest Schilling.  This happened when baby Kenneth was only about two weeks old.  So Kenneth was raised as the son of Ernest and Selma (in reality, they were his grandfather and step-grandmother), and he was always led to believe that Marguerite was his sister (actually his mother!).  Kenneth didn\'t discover the truth about Marguerite and \"Unknown\" Thompson until much, much later in life (after he was a father himself).
 
Kenneth is my grandfather.  So actually, Selma Dahl technically is not my great-grandmother.  She is really my great-great-step-grandmother.  In my family tree, I have two sets of lineages for my grandfather Kenneth.  The first lists Ernest and Selma as his parents.  The second lists Marguerite and \"Unknown\" Thompson as his parents, and the two lineages are obviously different from there on back.  Since I have been unable to find out much information about Marguerite and her mother Alice Louise Bunce, I primarily refer to Ernest and Selma as my great-grandparents and use that lineage.
 
Confused?  It took me forever to figure all of that out!  It was a big controversy in the Schilling family for awhile, but now everyone knows about it.
 
I have a webpage at the following address, which includes pictures of Selma Dahl, Ernest Schilling and Kenneth Schilling.  Here is the address:

             Nordahl Skarshaug of San Jose, CA and comes by

             book is a history of Numedahl - a genealogy of all the people
             who lived in Nore, Uvdal, Rodberg.  Loftsgard lists her great-
             grandfather as Svenn Gunelsen of Fonnebo, who married Gunhild
             Nilsdotter Oslien.  Their son was Gunul Svenson, who married
             Kari Knutsdotter Korsgarden about 1843.  So their children were
             GUNDERSON or SVENSON, depending on if they took their father\'s
             first name, Gunder (Gunul) or his last name, Svenson.
                Gunul Svenson had two sisters:  Gunhild, who married Torbjorn

              trying to ignore her Norwegian background\" and \"was quite
         typical of immegrants; she wished to forget her background in the `old

       in the Civil War Union Army and died shortly after in a Memphis, Tenn.
       hospital from chronic diarrhea.
MILITARY: A-026.  Residence listed as Elgin. Iowa, and age as 18, when he
       enlisted as a private in Company H of the 38th Regiment of Iowa
       Volunteers on Aug 15, 1862 to serve 3 years in the Civil War.  He is
       shown present for duty from the date of enrollment until June 30, 1863.
       He is absent on the July and August roll for reason of being sick since
       July 23 at Vicksburg, Miss.  Same report Oct, Nov and Dec 1863.  Death
       date listed as Dec 5, 1863.  Cause of death: chronic diarrhea.
       His name is listed as Swain Gunnelson.  On March 23, 1878, his father,
       listed as age 63, files a claim with the government (A-026) for Swain\'s
       pension.  Father gives his own name as Gunnel Swainson but signs the
       document by making \"his mark\" before witnesses, instead of writing his
       name.  The application states that Swain had no wife or children,
       and indicates that his mother was no longer living.  There is eveidence
       that Gunnel was given a required physical examination as a dependaent
       relative and as part of the application for Swains pension.  This
       examination was dated 1879 and indicates that, in the examining doctor\'s
       opinion, that Gunnel was, at that time, physically incapacitaed for the
       support of himself and his family.  The examination was given in Fayette
       Iowa.   On Mar 10, 1887, a letter from the Postmaster in Elgin, Iowa
       in response to an inquiry about the address of Gunnel Swainson,
       states that the postmaster believed Gunnel had died several years
       earlier.  But that an inquirey could be made at the Post Office  in
       Clayton County for further information.  It appears that Gunnel never
       received any of the pension applied for because a document signed
       by the attorney representing Gunnel in his application is marked, \"Dead\"
       and \"Abandoned\" on April 8, 1878.
DEATH: A-020-M says he was 18 when he died.

NOTES: Extractions from \"CHRONICLES OF A MINNESOTA PIONEER\" (D-012) by

       She spells her father\'s name, Niels Tobias Dahl. (also D-013 & D-014)
       And spells her mother\'s name, Tori Hoverson.
       \"When father came to America he was the only member of his family to
            come.  Later two of his brothers with their families came to our
            Dunn County home.  As all homesteads near there had been taken,
            the brothers moved on to Blue Earth County, Minnesota.\"  She is
            referring to Hans P. Dahl-482 and Tonnes A. Dahl-1294 who
            emmigrated in 1867 and 1868 respectively.  \" The villiage of
            Pemberton is located on land homsteaded by my uncle Tonnes Dahl.\"
            Nils came from Norway at the age of 20.  As soon as he was of age
            he homesteaded a farm in Coon Prairie, Wisc. and lived there until
            May 1865 when he moved to Dunn County, Wisc.  The villiage of
            Colfax is on the farmland they owned there.  In May 1870 he moved
            his family by covered wagon to Blue Earth County, Minn. where he
            lived for 3 years.  D-012, by daughter Tilla, describes her
            memories of growing up and life on the homestead in Cottonwood,
            Minn.  Nils sold the farm about 1878, soon after baby Herman died
            from chickenpox, and moved to Minneota, Minnesota in August, 1879.
            Nils had bought a farm a mile east of town and the children
            attended school in Minneota.  \"The school year 1948 was the first
            one in the history of Minneota when the public schools of the
            villiage had no member of the Dahl family among its pupils\". (D-012
            p.12)
            D-014 describes the emmigration of Niels Dahl and the early years
            in America.  Niels left Norway April 26, 1851, crossing the
            Atlantic in a small ship, (the passengers had to furnish their
            own provisions on the ship) landing in New York eight weeks later.
            From New York they travelled up the Hudson on a horse drawn canal
            boat (which was merely an open barge with no shelter from the
            weather) to Albany, and through the canal to Buffalo, N.Y. where
            they boarded a small sailboat and landed at Milwaukee, Wisc.
            There they bought ox teams and drove across the sparsely settled
            state to Vernon County, arriving in August.  They settled on
            homesteads on Coon Prairie, near what is now Westby, Wisconsin.
            Niels was the only member of his family to come at that time.
            Tori came a year later with her family, via the same route,
            and arrived in Coon Prairie about September 1852.  She was 14
            years old.  Tori remained in Milwaukee for 2 years wih friends so
            she could go to school, learn English and the American way of
            housekeeping, finally arriving in Coon Prairie by ox drawn wagon.
            After marriage Niels and Tori lived on the land he had
            homesteaded as soon as he had become of age, until May 1863 when
            they moved to Dunn County, Wisc.  The village of Colfax is on the
            farm they owned there.  The moved to Minnesota and back to Wisc.,
            then to Blue Earth Co., Minn again for about three years and
            then in 1873 homesteaded in Lyon Co., Minnesota on the west side
            Cottonwood Lake.  After 7 years, in Aug. 1879, they moved
            again and bought a farm in Eidsvold Township.  They lived one mile
            east of Minneota until Feb 22, 1897 when they moved to Minneota
            where they lived until their death
            D-025 says, Niels Tobias Dahl is the way it is listed on his

        Michigan, arriving at Eau Claire, Wisconsin about the middle of June.
        The next spring they moved to Medo, MN, (now Pemberton, MN ... the
        villiage of Pemberton being located on his homestead).  In September
        1888, moved to a farm three and one-half miles west of the new town of
        Cottonwood.  In December 1919 he left the farm and bought a home in
        Cottonwood.  On November 4, 1927, as he was going down to get the
        afternoon mail, he was killed instantly by the train at the crossing.
        The open bible, hymn book and other religious books on his table showed

       When he moved back to Oksendal, he bought the homeplace from his
       brother, Hans.
       D-014 reveals that he and eleven others were selected to be the king\'s
       special body guard.  Norway was then ruled by Denmark.  While in this
       service he recieved a uniform and a chest in which to keep his clothes.
       The chest, which is inscribed with the date 1776, is now (as of 1968) in
       the home of Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Deen, Minneota, Minn.  Buttons from the
       uniform and his honorable discharge were in the possession of Nils H.
       Dahl at Minot, N.D.  He was described in his discharge papers as being
       \'light hair, blue eyes, broad shoulders and strong legs\'.  \"It is said
       that once when the soldiers were lifting various objects to measure
       thier strength, that he placed his head under a horse and stood to full
       height with the horse hanging across his shoulders.  Asked by the king
       what they fed men in Norway to make them so strong, he answered - `Your
       Majesty, in Norway they feed the men the food you feed your horses ...
       oats.\'  This was true for the main food in Norway then was oatmeal\"
PROBLEM: D-024 lists b. date as 1765.
       D-042 indicates he was a farmer.  Was widely known for his great
       strength.  But attributes the bodygard duties to his son, Peder."

BURIAL: Hitterdal East Cemetery.
NOTES: D-042 lists him as cook in Norse army, farmer, sunday school teacher.
NOTES: D-042 says Lars and Anna were reared in Oxendal.  AT age 16 Lars
       emigrated to America and worked for his relatives (D-013 indicates
       he worked for Nils Dahl) in Southern Minnesota, attending school and
       learning English.  After 8 years he returned to Norway and worked on his
       father\'s farm for 3 years.  He then returned to America.  After spending
       2 years he returned to Norway, taking over the estate upon the death of
       his father.  Lars sold the estate, married, and together with his wife
       and his mother, returned once again to America (June 1908) and settled in
       Minneapolis, MN, where he worked for a time as a streetcar conductor.
       But city life did not appeal to Lars and Anna (who spoke no English)
       and they moved to Cottonwood, MN to be among relatives in a Norse
       community.  They farmed there for 7 years.  Their desire to own their
       own home in a christian community of their own nationality prompted
       their move to their farm near Hitterdal, MN where they lived out their
       lives.  Son, Olaf, goes on to relate that the average life of his
       paternal ancestors was between 75 and 94 years; his maternal side lived
       between 70 and 87 years of age.  His ancestors were blonde, fair
       complexioned, and had grey or blue eyes.  Olaf goes on to relate that
       his father\'s ancestors were were of a listless nature with not much
       enthusiasm for betterment of surrounding conditions, rather quiet and
       prefer to hear rather than speak.  His mother\'s ancestry was more
       concerned with finding ways to make things different and better, were
       often a bit outspoken, were outgoing, sociable and had a happy nature.
       Olaf notes that both sides of his ancestry were interested in reading,
       there were teachers, an author and also one who wrote a mathematics
       textbook.  His parents and grandparents were christian examples and
       taught their children reverence for the bible and prayer.  All of the
       ancestors had been born a raised in rural valleys between the mountains
       in Norway.  The male ancestry of both Lars and Anna had derived from
       Oxendal where farming is carried on on a small scale.  All the tillable
       land was used for agriculture while the mountain slopes were used for
       raising hay and for pasturing cattle and sheep.  Wood cut from the
       mountainsides had to be transported (as did the hay) to the valley below.
       Fishing was not commercialized but was carried on a a source of food.
       Oxendal had had a religious awakening at one time and the community had
       their own pastor and the children were thoroughly instructed in the
       catechism and, at public school, in church history.  Travel to the
       nearest town, Flekkefjord, a distance of about 30 miles, was by boat.
       Life was meager and not without hardship and many left to come to
       America to seek their fortune.  They found work in the lumber camps of

father\'s father were all school teachers in Norway and quite well off.  However, Lars didn\'t like teaching - and was poor - so he left Norway and went to live with his Uncle in Cottonwood, MN.  With money he saved while working on the railroad there and with a loan from his Uncle, he brought his wife and seven children to America.  His wife died shortly after arriving in Cottonwood and is buried there.  Lars needed help raising his young family and he wrote to his wife\'s widowed sister in Norway asking her to come to America and marry him.  She did, bringing three children with her.  They found a small farm on a small lake (7th Crow Wing) in Nevis, MN and there they lived out their remaining years.  NOTE: MRIN-531 goes on to list some achievements and notations for several of Lars\' grandchildren."

NOTES: Nils\' parents were Ditev Ephraim Jaeger (1802-1866, d. in Norway) and
       Catherine Dorothea Bergfeldt (1803-1861, d. in Norway).
NOTES:  Nils was the first postmaster of Minneota, Minn. (D-012 p.11)
        The original settlement, now called Minneota, was called \'Pumpa\',
        Norwegian for \'pump\'.  The Chicago Northwestern trains stopped to take
        on water. Nils had come from Norway and had had a better education than
        most of the pioneers.  His father was a preacher.  Nils had the first
        store and post office in Minneota.  The post office was established in
        1871 and the town took on the name, Norland, reason not known but might
        have been because so many Norwegians living in the area had emmigrated
        from Norland, Norway.  Because mail destined for Norseland often ended
        up in Norland and mail to Norland would often be sent to Norseland, the
        Post Office Department notified Nils Jager that it would be necessary
        to change the name of the town.  An election was held and the name that
        got the most votes was \'Jagersville\'.  However, a certain resident of
        town, named Doc Seals had contacted the Senator from Minnesota, H. B.
        Strait and he had was influential in having the town named Minneota.
        The day after the local election, Nils Jager recieved notice from the
        Post Office Department that the town had been named Minneota. (D-012
        p.11)
        Jeanne (Jaeger) Horsey (in documentation attached to MRIN-547) explains
        that the origional spelling in Norway was Nils Winther LUTH-JAEGER with
        a hyphen.  Reason: When Nils\' parents, Ditlev LUTH and his wife,
        Claudine Marie WINTHER died in June and August 1774, Nils was adopted
        by Ephraim JEAGER and JAEGER was added to Nils\' name.  Ephram Jaeger
        was an unmarried relative, a pastor.  It followed that the first Nils
        Winther Lars-Jaeger named his son Ditlev Ephraim Jaeger (dropping the
        LUTH).  Then Ditlev\'s son was named Nils Winther Luth Jaeger and he
        named his son Ditlev Ephraim Jaeger (Jeanne [Jaeger] Horsey\'s uncle)
D-023 (an Ancestry Chart) lists 2 more generations of ancestors for Nils.

NOTES: H-015 from the book, REVOLUTIONARY WAR SOLDIERS AND PATRIOTS BURIED IN

          1. \"Portrait and Biographical Album\" of Washington County, Iowa
              states that Samuel Lewis was born in Maryland, then moved with his
              family to Virginia, Kentucky, and in 1822 to Indiana and finally
              in 1845 to Washington County, Iowa.
          2. The 1850 census lists Samuel Lewis, age 84, born in Ireland,
             blind, and living with his son, William B. Lewis.
          3. The National Archives has no pension record for Samuel Lewis.
          4. Three men by the same name are appear on the muster rolls of the
             3rd and 5th Virginia Regiments.  It is believed he was a private
             in the 3rd Virginia Regiment serving in various places in New York
             and New Jersey.
          5. In a dedication service June 14, 1957, Nancy and Jimmy Baird,
             direct descendants of Samuel Lewis, unveiled a marker which
             made from a boulder with a bronze plate attached and placed by
             his tombstone in Hillcrest Cemetery, Brighton, Iowa and was

BAPTISM: H-009. At the Parish of Dundee.
IMMIGRATION: H-009 relates that John, his 2 brothers, and his father left
             Scotland to arrive in New York in 1849, but for some unknown
             reason they returned immediately to Scotland.  However in the
             same year they again sailed for America, this time to stay.
             The events of their second journey are related in a letter now
             held by a family member (see H-009, P. 163) which tells a story of
             about 3 months of stormy seas, finally surviving on ship by
             collecting and drinking rain water and eating from small rations
             of dried beans and peas.
NOTES: Not much is know of the early years in America, but from tradition it is
       believed that John first worked in the shipyards in New York.  The next
       record is of his marriage to Jane at Galena, IL.  Soon after their
       marriage John and Jane moved to Dubuque Co., Iowa whrer all of their

NOTES: (A-020-K) Alert Palmer Aanestad makes some comments in this handwritten

       1. He knows of only two children for her parents, Svenn and Gunhild.
          (There are three)
       2. He does not know whether she came to America with her brother or at
             a different time.
       3. He says he has heard her spoken of as \"Faster\" (Fars soster).
       4. He does not know if she was married before she came to America.  Her
             married name was Enerson.  And her family (sons and daughters)
             lived in the Rose Creek area in Minnesota \"the year that Helge
             visited them (1896-7?).  Probably Faster also lived there - a widow
             in 1900 or so when Ma, with me along, visited her (I was then 5
             and vaguely remember) and received the rok, spinning wheel, which
             Alma now has.\"
       5. Then he lists \"Faster\'s\" sons and daughters (per Helge)
A-020-h says this family lived around Rose Creek area, Minn.  Possible also in
        Fillmore Co., Minn.  A notaion states that the Bisbes and Martin names
        tie to this family.  Also Reinhardt?
A-020-Y says the roK was origionally owned by \"Faster\".  Gunhild was thought to
have brought it from Norway.  5 children are listed by name.

         (A-020-c) Palmer lists this name as Raghnild Svensdotter Bekkeset.
         (A-020-d) says b. date was about 1834 and Marr date was 1846.
         The b. date seems wrong.  Further on A-020-d says she was 43 years
         old in an 1865 census.  This would make the b. date about 1822.
         The marr. date seems to be a direct translation.
NOTES: (A-020-c) Alert Palmer Aanestad makes some comments in this handwritten
                 account of his understanding of Gunhild\'s family in 1982,
                 probably after his translation of some Norwegian History sent
                 to him by Sammie Lois Lang that year.  He now lists 3 children
                 for Svenn.   Some of Palmer\'s comments:
          1. Any relatives of ours through Sven Gunulsen\'s descendants still
             living in Norway would be through Raghnild and Hans Nilsen.
          2. Of Hans Nilsen\'s children:  the girls who married would not have
             the name, Bekkeset.
          3. The son, Nils, married but obviously did not live on Bekkeset, as
             son Halvar was the owner after their father died.  Halvar sold the
             farm to Nils Torseinsen of South Bekkeset, no relative of ours."
"8826","","fitzvalley","!SO: A-020-c
PROBLEM: (A-20-c) Palmer gives this name as Hans Nilsen Skonneset (later

         History for Sammie Lois Lang.  Palmer lists 8 children.
A-020-d says he was listed as 43 years old in an 1865 census, making his year

NOTES: Halvor and Margit had no children.
MARRIAGE: Date from A-020-d.  Halvor apparantly was not married until age 52.
A-020-d says that he farmed Bekkeset and his sisters, Ragnhild and Sigrid, kept
         house for him.  He was quite involved in the affairs of the community
         and was a director of the Nore Savings Bank.  About 1938 he sold the
         farm (North Bekkeset) to Nils Torstensen of South Bekkeset, retaining
         lifetime rights for himself and his wife.  However, his wife, Margit,
         died in 1938 at the age of 61.  Halvor died in 1941, age 73.
         As of 1963, Nils Torstensen and wife Inga Olsdotter were still the
         residents of North Bekkeset."

NOTES: D-042 relates that Sondre was an only child.  And after his mother died,
      he wanted to take over the farm, Reishus.  However his father was
      unwilling to turn the place over to him, apparantly becauce Sondre\'s
      father was intending to remarry and remain on the farm.  Sondre and
      Ingeborg decided to go to America and the remainder of this `REISHUS
      FAMILY SAGA\' deals with the details of the trip and the beginnings in
      America.  They eventually bought 120 acres of farm land at First Lake,
      a distance of about 80 miles from Milwakee, WI.  In 1853 the railroad
      came through a corner of their land. and the Indians had traded land to
      the whites that same year.  Minnesota was still a Territiory.
      In 1854 they moved to Minnesota locating at the Root River in Fillmore
      County, where the town of Rushford would later be established.  They did
      well on their farm there.  In the fall of 1856? they sold their wheat for
      $1.50 per bushel."

    house.  He was granted a piece of land which ended at the perpendicular
    wall of mountain.  Here he cleared the land and built an unusual cabin by
    leaning huge timbers against the moutain wall.  Because of the unusual
    construction, the farm became known as REISHUS.  (REIS: a V shaped log
    pile.).  It was here that he brought his bride to live.  Her name was
    Ragna. Sandre and Ragna has seven children, all girls.  Ragnhild was the

Dear Bill,
 
Hi!  Thank you so much for the information you sent.  I\'m getting ready to start entering the information into my files.
 
The story about Selma Martine Dahl and Ernest Adolph Schilling is rather interesting.  Before Ernest married Selma, he was married to a woman name Alice Louise Bunce.  They had a daughter, Marguerite Mary Schilling.  When Marguerite was very young, Ernest and Alice divorced and he married Selma.  Now, when Mary was still a teenager, she became pregnant by an \"Unknown\" Thompson, and gave birth to a son, Kenneth Ernest Thompson.  Since she was still living with Ernest and Selma, and since \"Unknown\" Thompson disappeared, she decided to let Ernest and Selma adopt her baby, changing the baby\'s name from Kenneth Ernest Thompson to Kenneth Ernest Schilling.  This happened when baby Kenneth was only about two weeks old.  So Kenneth was raised as the son of Ernest and Selma (in reality, they were his grandfather and step-grandmother), and he was always led to believe that Marguerite was his sister (actually his mother!).  Kenneth didn\'t discover the truth about Marguerite and \"Unknown\" Thompson until much, much later in life (after he was a father himself).
 
Kenneth is my grandfather.  So actually, Selma Dahl technically is not my great-grandmother.  She is really my great-great-step-grandmother.  In my family tree, I have two sets of lineages for my grandfather Kenneth.  The first lists Ernest and Selma as his parents.  The second lists Marguerite and \"Unknown\" Thompson as his parents, and the two lineages are obviously different from there on back.  Since I have been unable to find out much information about Marguerite and her mother Alice Louise Bunce, I primarily refer to Ernest and Selma as my great-grandparents and use that lineage.
 
Confused?  It took me forever to figure all of that out!  It was a big controversy in the Schilling family for awhile, but now everyone knows about it.
 
I have a webpage at the following address, which includes pictures of Selma Dahl, Ernest Schilling and Kenneth Schilling.  Here is the address:

Thank you again for all of the information!

"11046","","fitzvalley","He was a gentleman of great and varied culture, and a Statesman of enlarged conservative views. He was not a politician in the usual acceptation of the word, and yet was one of the most successful public men in Maryland during the period of his life. Honors and offices waited upon him. His success was due entirely to his own individual merit,--to his unsullied integrity and capacity for public affairs,--and the appreciation of his eminent qualities, by his fellow citizens. His death was regarded by men of all parties as a loss to the country, and deplored as a national calamity. He was reputed to be one of the wisest and safest statesmen in that august body, the Senate of the United States; and the minds of the people were turning towards him as a proper candidate for the Presidency, when death removed him from the Councils of the Nation. He d., leaving behind him a reputation which adds to the treasury of national honor, and a name which adorns the History of Maryland, and will be cherished in Kent by generations unborn.

Mr. Pearce was born the 14th of Dec. 1805, at the residence of his grandfather, Dr. Elisha Cullen Dick, in Alexandria, Va. His mother d. when he was very young, and his early education was received in Alexandria, under the direction of his grandfather. He entered Princeton College at the early age of fourteen, and was graduated in 1822, before he had completed his sixteenth year, dividing the honors of his class with Hugo Mearns, of Pennsylvania, and Edward D. Mansfield, of Ohio, both of whom were men of mature years and minds, and were distinguished in after life: the first for general scholarship, and the latter in the Law, being the Professor of Constitutional Law, for many years, in the Cincinnati College. Among his classmates, also, were George R. Richardson, Attorney General of Maryland, one of the brightest ornaments of the Maryland bar in his day, and Albert B. Dod, of New Jersey, afterwards a Professor in Princeton College, and one of the most brilliant rhetoricians and lecturers in this country.

It was the custom of the College at that period for one member of each class, at graduation, to write verses descriptive of the character of each one of the class, in the order of the roll-call, which was called the \"Honoriad;\" and was written by him best qualified by the voice of the class for the task. The HONORIAD for the class of 1822 was written by William Augustine Washington, of Virginia. The verses descriptive of Mr. Pearce will show the estimate placed on him by his associates and class-mates. They are as follows:

\"PEARCE!

     \"With undissembled joy and homage free 
     Attractive Genius, next we turn to thee! 
     \'Tis good to pause, and ponder on the mind, 
     Where all thy charms, thy countless charms, we find; 
     Where all thy vast and varied powers are shown, 
     And where thy pleasure \'tis to place thy throne. 
     In thee, admired Pearce! a mind is found, 
     Where all these charms and all these powers abound. 
     Yes! Fancy,--Wit,--and Judgment all appear 
     To meet and shed their mingled radiance here. 

     Hence JIM, we like to linger on thy name, 
     To tell thy value,--hear thy merit\'s claim, 
     Display thine honest excellence, and pause 
     To pay our trifling tribute of applause. 
     Fain would the Muse have all thy worth expressed, 
     But dreads to put her talent to the test. 
     Oh! could she borrow but one tithe of thine, 
     Around that brow, that honored brow, she\'d twine 
     As fair a wreath as ever learning\'s lore 
     Or princely pride in proudest moment bore.\" 

After leaving College, Mr. Pearce studied law in Baltimore, with the late Judge Glenn, and was admitted to the Bar in 1824. Shortly after his admission, he commenced the practice of his profession in Cambridge, where he remained about a year; after which, he went to Louisiana and engaged in sugar planting, on the Red River, with his father. He remained there about three years, and then returned to Kent, where he spent the rest of his honored life. On his return to Maryland he resumed the practice of the law, at the same time carrying on the farm, upon which he resided. He was not, however, permitted to devote himsef to his profession, as he desired, for he was early called into public life. In 1831 he was sent to the Legislature of Maryland, and in 1835 he was elected a member of the House of Representatives, and with the exception of a single Term in 1839, when he was defeated by a small majority by the Hon. Philip F. Thomas, he was re-elected, from time to time, till 1843. In 1843 he was transferred to the United States Senate, where he was continued, by four successive elections, until his death, the 20th day of December 1862. During this long period of public service, the Library of Congress, the Botanical Gardens, the Smithsonian Institute, and the Coast Survey Department were favorite objects of his fostering care, and received great and valuable attention from him, while at the same time he faithfully, conscientiously, and with distinguished ability discharged all the Senatorial duties of a Legislator.

He was offered a seat on the Bench of the United States District Court, for the State of Maryland, by President Fillmore, and during the same Presidential Term was nominated and confirmed Secretary of the Interior; both of which positions he declined, preferring to remain in the Senate, where he believed he could be more useful to his country. He left a son, now residing in Chestertown, who worthily bears his honored name, James Alfred Pearce, and illustrates, at the bar, the \"honest excellence\" of his distinguished father. He is now (9th Aug. 1875) the capable State\'s Attorney in and for Kent County, Maryland.

The family came to Clayton County when our subject was about ten years old and settled in what is now Mallory Township. Ten years later they removed to Elk Township, where James S. was married on January 26, 1858 to Mary, daughter of George and Margaret (Kahel) Radabach. She is a native of Pennsylvania. Of eleven children born of this union, ten are living - Jacob M., who married Cora Wolidge, Hannah E, wife of John Dutton; James S., William S., Margaret E., Earnest M., Aaron, Lilly M., Amos R. and Jesse H.

In September, 1862 Mr. Walter enlisted in Company G, Sixth Iowa Cavalry and served until the close of the war, then returned home and followed farming in Delaware County five years. He then erected his present mill, which contains three sets of burrs and all the latest improved machinery. In politics he is a Republican and has held various local offices.

Chuck attended Augusta High School in Columbiana County through the eleventh grade.  He was employed at the Transue and Williams Stamping Plant and Alliance Machine before entering the US Navy.  After returning from his military duty during World War II, Chuck worked at Alliance Hardware and then went into the plumbing business.  Eventually he began doing heating work as well and his business then bacame HAGAN HEATING AND PLUMBING which was founded in 1956.  After his death, his youngest son, John, took over the family business.

Chuck enlisted in the United States Navy in the place of his younger brother, Sherm, in October 1942 and served for thirty-five months.  He was a ship fitter and served on the U.S.S. Cincinnati, which was a light cruiser, and the U.S.S. Quincy, a heavy cruiser.  His ship was one of the front ships present at the invasion of Normandy and was fired upon.  His ship was also one of those present when the treaty to end the war was signed in Japan.  His daughter, Marikay, recalls him telling her that during the war the President came onboard his ship at one point and actually spoke to Chuck.

In August 1947, Chuck and Mary Helen purchased the 48.5 acre farm at 11301 Marlboro Avenue, NE, Marlboro Township, Alliance, Ohio which would become the Hagan Family Farm.  Their youngest son, John, and his family still reside there in 2003.

Chuck was diagnosed with colon cancer in the Spring of 1974 and, from August, 1974 until his death, he spent time in and out of hospitals for treatment for his illness.  Eventually, the cancer spread  to his liver which resulted in his death.

Chuck had blue eyes and was 5\'11\" tall.  He loved to read."

"11076","","fitzvalley","In the 1910 Columbiana County, Ohio Census, \"Kennet\" is residing with his son, Harvey, and Harvey\'s family.

From a letter written by Louise (Mrs. Russell) Stokey Coy on 6 June 1981:

\"At the age of 3, Ken Coy left his [Russell\'s] mother 
with seven kids to bring up, feed, and clothe.  He was 
raised in poverty and grew up with a deep sense of 
hatred for his father so he was never curious about the 
Coy background.  The only father he ever knew was his  
stepfather, Frank Drake, who was truly a good man but 
was crippled so he didn\'t earn enough money to support 
a large family, if it hadn\'t been for Joe Faloon whose 
home they lived in they would have gone hungry.\"

Ken and his first wife, though they both had remarried, are buried next to each other.

In the 1930 Columbiana County, Ohio Census, Kenn resides in Hanover Twp. and lives alone as the Head of Household.  He provides his age as 68 years, born in Pennsylvania to parents born in  Ohio (his mother was born in Indiana), and states that he is widowed.  His occupation is identified as a farmer on a \"general farm\".

His father\'s Pension File states that Ken was born in 1861 though his tombstone states 1859.  However, the fact that he is not listed as born in the 1860 Pennsylvania Census suggests that the Pension File provides the correct year."

In the biographical sketch of A.W. Stambaugh in History of Stark County with an outline sketch of Ohio edited by William Henry Perrin, his grandfather is identified as Rev. Henry Stambaugh.  This source does not mention Henry and Catharina\'s children Jacob or Hannah but does mention a son \"Josiah\", a daughter, \"Emma\", and a second daughter bearing the name \"Catharine\" that are not mentioned in any other document or resource that I have yet found.

That same source explains that Henry married Catharine \"...and with his family of children emigrated to Ohio, crossing the river at Pittsburg in a ferryboat.  He came to New Lisbon, Ohio, where he rented land twelve years, but finally made his way to the county [Stark], and settled first in Nimishillen Tp., when it was all a wilderness; remaining here seven years, when, he removed to Canton and remained seven years, and finally located in Portage Co., where he died in 1866.  He was a minister of the Albright faith, as were also John and Jacob, his brothers, but later in life joined the United Brethren Church. (page 968).\"

According to that same county history, Henry\'s \"...ancestor was Philip, a native of Alsace on the Rhine.  He and several brothers came to York Co., Pa., and settled there previous to the war of the Revolution.  The children of Philip were --- Jacob, Henry, John, Catharine, Mary and Elizabeth.  Philip was remarkably fond of hunting and the chase, and upon his arrival in Pennsylvania, purchased several hundred acres of land at South Mountain, in Adams Co., Pa. (967).\"

SHILLING

Collins C Shilling was born in 1844/1845 in Ohio, son of C. H. Shilling (f=PA, m=OH). Shilling was married prior to 1867 to Mary M George. Mary was born in 1839/1840 in Ohio (parents=PA). 

Colin Shilling owned 67 acres in Long Lake township in 1879[127]. In 1880, the Shillings lived on a farm in Long Lake twp[128]. Collins was appointed constable of Long Lake twp in 1881 and 1882. In March 1882 he began to build a 16 ft by 28 ft addition to his house. In October of 1882 he purchased a team for $315[129]. Colin was well known as a well digger. He put in a well for Elijah Cox in August 1885 and was \"prepared to do such work at any time\"[130]. 

Colin\'s brother visited in March 1884 and announced that he intended to move to Long Lake. Meanwhile Colin finished his house building. In October 1884, Colin ran Mr. Algier\'s threshing machine and threshed 724 bushels in 32 minutes. Later that year:  C. C. Shilling informed your localist that he had for sale one pair of lumber sleighs for the small sum of $23. Colin\'s brother Silas Shilling returned to southern Michigan in February 1885. In September, Silas purchased a new threshing machine and reported that it was giving entire satisfaction. The greater amount of threshing is done. We secured the services of C. C. Shillings in threshing our grain, and we desire to say that we never had better work done since coming to this section. His terms are also very reasonable. His charges are four cents for threshing peas, 3 1/2 cents for wheat, and two cents for oats[131].

The Shillings hosted a party in April 1886. Colin received a back pension in April 1887  for Civil War service. He finished his last threshing job of the year in early October. In 1888 he built a new barn and purchased an engine for his threshing machine. He also lost a cow and calf by eating \"paris green\" (apparently a poisenous plant). Colin was elected a moderator for the school meetings in September 1888. In December, Colin and his son were cutting wood with a wood machine. He was elected constable in 1889 and was also the pathmaster, making sure the roads were kept up[132].

Collins became a member of the Long Lake Friends Church in 1883 and Mary and daughter Ella in 1884. Collins condemned himself for using profane language in 1885. Collins, Mary, and daughter Cora resigned from the church in 1890[133]. In July 1792, C. F. Powell and Joshua Simmonds built a house for the Shillings[134]. Collins died on 13 November 1898 from septicemia in Traverse City[135].

PARTICULARS REGARDING THE DEATH OF W. H. PRICE.

Concerning the death of Conductor Price, reported in the Shield yesterday the ASkron Times-Demoncrat says:

William Henry Price of Galion one fo the oldest and best known conductors on the Erie railroad was struck and instantly killed by B. & O. passenger train No. 5, at 2:50 Thursday morning, near Exchange street this city.

Price was running an east bound freight train on the Erie and had just pulled into the Exchange street siding making a stop to do some switching and pick up some cars to take on to Kent.  Price rode on the locomotive until the train stopped, so as to be able to direct the engineer.

Just as the train stopped, Price stepped down and in a cloud of steam and the noise of his own train, he was unable to see or hear, and stepped onto the B. & O. tracks just as the fast passenger came running by.  He was struck and hurled about fifty feet.

Another member of his crew who saw the accident rushed to Price, but life was already extinct.  The injuries were a fractured skull, a broken leg and bruises about the spine.

Park\'s ambulance took the remains to the morgue and they will be taken to Galion this evening by a committee from Crawford Division Order Railway Conductors, of which the decedent has been, for many years, financial secretary.  This committee arrived from Galion this morning.

Mr. Price was about 54 years old.  He was twice married and lieaves (sic) his wife and five children.  Two of the children live here, Mrs. Albert R. Stannah, 290 Perkin(s) street and J. N. Price 504 Ohio street.  Mr. Price was a prominent member of several secret societies and of the Disciple church, being one of the officials of  the Galion church, under the pastorate of Rev. John P. Sala, formerly of this city.

A peculiar feature of the accident is that Mrs. Price is left a widow for the second time by railway accident, her first husband having met death in a similar manner ten years ago.  She was married about four years ago to Mr. Price.

The dead man had been in the employ of the Erie all his life and had run a train for may years.  He was one of the most popular men on the road.  He has several brothers who also work for the Erie."

Through her research of Civil War records, Dorothy Weiser Seale explains in her book that 

Ephraim enlisted in the Union Army on 4 November 1861 
as a Private with Co. K. 65th Regiment, Ohio Volunteer  
Infantry, at Hancock Co., Ohio for a period of three years.    
On 8 November 1862 he was appointed Corporal, and on 2            May 1863 he was appointed Sergeant.  On 31 December 1863         he mustered out and was discharged so that he might re-enlist         as a Veteran Volunteer.  He rejoined the following day 1                January 1864 at Chattanooga, Tenn., was again appointed                Sergeant and received $160 bounty.  Ephraim was taken                  prisoner in action at the engagement at Spring Hill, Tenn. on           29 November 1864 which was fought between Union troops          under Gen. John Schofield and a Confederate army under               Gen. John Bell Hood, 10 miles from Franklin.  He was               paroled at Vicksburg, Miss. on or about 21 April  1865.  At              Vicksburg, the steamer Sultana took on the paroled prisoners,          comprising of 33 officers and 1, 833 men.  On the night of 27          April 1865, the boilers exploded and the steamer sank.                Seventeen officers and 1,084 men were lost.  Ephraim                   survived the disaster, but was mistakenly reported killed.               Following the explosion of the Sultana, he was admitted to             Soldier\'s Home in Memphis for a short time.  On 7 May 1865          he reported to Camp Chase, Ohio and was mustered out on 22        May 1865 as a Sergeant.  Medical records after his return home        from the service show that in 1865 he was suffering from              rheumatism ans neuralgia...


Ms. Seale explains that it is alleged that Ephraim died in Saguache, Saguache Co., Colorado before 1896 although her search discovered that there is no tombstone on record for him there and there are no death records available for that time period.  However, Saguache was his last known address.  Government records indicate that in 1894 and \"...in 1896 Lucinda, then residing in McComb, Ohio,  was still trying to find out if a pension were being paid to...\" him.  Ephraim\'s health ailments may be the reason that he \"...left his family and sought the dry climate in Colorado.\"  However, Ms. Seale\'s research indicates that

His Civil War records indicate that he may have abandoned his       family and remarried, for he was the subject of a search by his       mother and his wife through the Bureau of Pensions.  If he       deserted his wife and children, Lucinda may have remarried, for       in Ephraim\'s Civil War papers, obtained from National Archives       in Washington, D.C., she was known as Lucinda Mathias, and       later as Lucinda Lynn (page 332)."

However, on 20 February 1863, he was made Captain of Company A, 65th Regiment. 
On 28 May 1864, John 

...was wounded...in the Battle of New Hope Church, Georgia,       near Dallas, in the Atlanta Campaign.  He received a severe         gun shot wound to the left side, in the lower portion of the         pleura and lung.  On 26 October 1864 near Alpine, Ga., Capt.         John tendered his resignation to Brig. Gen. W.D. Whipple...         \"because I have been in the service for three years, my father         died in March, 1864 leaving my mother, and the wife and three         children of one of my brothers who is serving in this                 regiment, with no one to care for them.  In June 1864 our                dwelling house was burned with all its contents and the two            families are suffering much for want of someone to look after         them.\"  His request was granted and his resignation accepted           17 December 1864.


After mustering out of the cervice, John resided in Franklin County, Kansas and Allen County, Indiana before returning to Putnam County in 1883.

Ms. Seale explains that John died due to consumption which resulted from his Civil War wound.  \"He made his own funeral sermon arrangements with S. H. Raudebaugh shortly before his death.

Larry L. Gray
Died December 9, 1999
WILLIAMSBURG - Larry L. Gray, 55, of Williamsburg and formerly of Ft. Meyers, Fla., died Thursday morning at the home of his aunt Mary Lautner.
Larry was born on July 24, 1944, in Dundee, and soon after was adopted by Garl and Claribel (Boerner) Gray. He had been a summer resident to the Grand Traverse and Benzie areas, and became a permanent resident in 1994.
Larry attended the Flint School for the Deaf until his 18th birthday. He was a very caring and loving person, who especially loved children and animals. He read his bible faithfully and shared his knowledge with others. He was an excellent signor, which helped him in his many travels.
Larry is survived by his aunts and uncles, Mary (Merlin) Lautner and Alice Gates of Williamsburg, Helen Gray and Zane (Virginia) Gray of Interlochen, Bryce (Darlene) Gray of Honor, Pauline Boerner of Grand Rapids; many, many cousins; and a very special friend, Greg Dobbs in Ft. Myers.

Lesan, were born in Sebec, Maine. George W. Lesan was born February 11, 1830. Mary M. Lesan was born February 27, 1837.  In early life they removed to Stark county IL.  They were married March 13, 1853.  In 1855 they removed to Ringold County, where they have resided ever since. They -lived on a farm near here until 1894 when they took up their residence in Mt. Ayr. Seven children were born to this couple, four of whom are living and all are married. The last one married was their youngest child, Dr. C. T. Lesan of Mount Ayr, who was married 6 months ago. This aged couple have fifteen grand-children.  Mr. and Mrs. Lesan are enjoying the best of health. They celebrated their golden wedding March 13 of this year. A rather peculiar incident of this golden wedding was the presence of seven persons who witnessed the original marriage fifty years ago.    Mr. and Mrs. Lesan are members of the Methodist Episcopal church.    Mr. Lesan is a total abstainer and does not use tobacco. Mr. Lesan was a republican for many years but drifted into the greenback movement and later on became a devoted follower of W. J. Bryan. The children and grand-children all reside in this county and are frequent visitors at the old folks\' home. There are in all about one hundred and fifty persons living in this county named Lesan, and all are related. George W. Lesan seems to be a sort of chief among the Lesans.  This couple lives contented and happy and are respected by all who know them.

!NOTES:  I first met Robert Carlton Lesan when I was about nine years old.  He had married my sister in New York City.  He often told the tale of how they met in a bar where she played the piano.  After their marriage they went to live in Detroit, Michigan where Sonny, as we always called him, worked as a saleman for the Smithfield Deviled Ham Company.  Max brought him home to Lebanon to meet the family.  They took me back to Detroit where I spent a month with them living in a tiny two room apartment.  Max was not working at this time.

Within a year the young couple came to Lebanon because Sonny was out of work..  They
stayed with my folks for awhile.  Sonny got a job selling insurance for Western an and Southern Life Insurance Company.  They set up housekeeping on the second floor of a house on the north side of Mulberry St about four blocks from downtown and just a short block or two from Grandma Fraser.  Max got pregnant and delivered a baby boy which they named after my father, Thomas Charles. Sonny did fairly well selling insurance and soon they moved to an apartment on the top floor of what was the Old Normal University.  The building was located across the street from the  Warren Co. Court House.  Sonny bought a plymouth coup so he could get around easier on his insurance collections.  Their  daughter Nan and the  second Robert Carlton were born while they lived in these apartments. Sonny spent a lot of hours at the Elks Club in Lebanon.  The couple finally bought a little cottage on Highland Ave.  They were very proud of their house.  Sonny finally lost his job with Western and Southern and went to work selling automatic tire changers.  By this time I had completed nursing school, married and returned from Hawaii.

 We were living in the old Crosier Apartments.  One morning a neighbor came knocking at my door and shouting that Sonny had had an accident. He had slipped on the fire escape at the rear of the Elks Hall   He went over the top of the railing and landed on his head in the coal shoot.  He crawled from there to the rear of Wyatt\' Grill.  Everyone thought he  was inebriated, so they took him home.  I dressed quickly when I heard,  and the neighbor took me to the Lesan cottage where I found Sonny in critical shape.  He was irrational and
uncontrollable.   I over- rode the Dr. that had been called, called an ambulance and took him to Miami Valley Hospital.  It was too late to save his life.  He died a few hours later of a skull fracture.

Sonny came from a wealthy family.  He grew up in Scarsdale, NY. His folks were Christian Scientists. Sonny had been greatlyaffected when his father died of pnuemonia.  He could never forgive his motherfor not calling a doctor. After the death of his father, his mother, Rosina, returned to Arkansas where she became a Christian Science reader in Eureka Springs. She visited Sonny and Max once a year. She was an unusual woman.  She often seemed cold and aloof to our family, as we were all very outgoing.

Sonny did not go to college.  Oh, he tried, but we used to laugh when he would say he had been kicked out of the best schools.  His parents gave up when he was thrown out of Antioch College in Ohio.

Sonny had a brother, David, and two sisters, Debbie and Rosemary.  All were raised in Scarsdale.  Rosemary was the oldest.  She was in advertising in NYC.  Debbie was married to the son of the AT&T owners. David was a writer and would be actor who was married and had two daughters.

Sonny had been married before he met Max.  He had a son and daughter by his first wife.  The marriage ended in an unpleasant divorce.  His first wife did not permit him to see the children.  They grew up never knowing their father.

Despite all of his frailties, his alcoholism, for he was an alcoholic, I loved this man.  Knowing that this will be read by his children and grandchildren, I have had difficulty referring to him as an alcoholic, but he was as was my sister.  He would have times when he would go many months without touching alcohol, and suddenly he would be off the wagon.  I have no doubt that he would have been or could have been a very successful man if he had not been addicted to alcohol.  He was well liked and made friends easily.  Everyone in Lebanon knew him.  He was my friend and the only brother I ever had."

Thomas Charles Lesan was the first child born to Maxine Fraser and Robert Carlton Lesan.  He was born at the Osteopathic Hospital in Dayton, Ohio. He graduated from High School in Lebanon, Ohio. Graduated with a B.S. from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio where he met his wife, Sylvia Dykes.  They were married at the Methodist Church in Lebanon, shortly after they graduated from Miami.  Their marriage did not have the approval of Sylvia\'s parents, primarily because Tom was not Catholic.  All was forgiven by the time the children came along.

Tom joined the airforce after they were married.  He had loved airplanes since he was a small boy.  He used to draw airplanes in every free moment he had. Skeet Fred taught him to fly when he was about 14.  Tom became a fine pilot and loved every minute in the Airforce.  He was stationed in Germany and England. He and Syl had three children, all of whom were educated in schools on the bases where they were stationed.  Tom was a U 2 pilot for several years, and while he was in that program the family lived in California.

After Tom got out of the U 2 Program he went up the career ladder, and when he wasn\'t overseas, he was stationed at the Pentagon.  They lived in Burke, VA during those years.  Tom made it to full Colonel and then retired.  His military experience was one of which he could be proud. He was a pilot in Vietnam and had many dangerous missions and received many medals for his service.

Tom was and is a handsome guy.  He has a great personality, and is always the life of the party.  He likes to party, but he likes to work.  After he retired from the AF he went to work for the company that had the balloons which were used in the drug programs to detect flying objects  coming into the states.  He was located in Yuma, Arizona. In 1996 they sold their home in Yuma, Tom quit his job, and they moved to an apartment in Gilbert, AZ while they waited for the completion of their new home.  The home they built was a big, 3000 square feet of beauty.  Sylvia fullfilled her lifelong dream of furnishing it to her
satisfaction. They moved in in Feb. 1977.

Tom and Syl have a closely knit family and have  a great relationship with their kids.  Just as our families have always done they make a lot out of hollidays. They have included Don and I in many of their family activities. Tom and I were only 13 years apart in age, just as his mother and I, sometimes we were aunt and newphew, and sometimes we were brother and sister. He was an important part of my life.[LesanRC2.FTW]

Notes:

My favorite memories of Nan are when she was a baby and I was a young high school girl. It seems I was appointed her sitter.  I used to take her walks after school each day.  She was such a beautiful baby, and had such a sweet disposition. I didn\'t see much of her as she went through her teenage years.  I had a family by that time.  I do remember that she was a chubby little girl with a smile for everyone.

The smile is still there, but the years have changed Nan.  She is about 5\'7\" tall and very thin.  She is a very capable woman, and a wonderful mother.  She started her career after graduation from Ohio State with Berk Research and Marketing Co. in Cincinnati. She traveled all over the country on research projects.  She lived with her mother in Lebanon, and when she was home she spent a lot of time with Herb Sempsrott.  They were finally married.  Herb fixed up the old Harvey home on High St. in Lebanon.  It was while living there that David and Sidney were born and grew up.

During the children\'s school years and even after their college, Nan worked at the flooring store on Columbus Ave.  She became an integral part of the business,  and they did well until hard financial times came in the 80\'s.  Nan started working part time at the store and part time for another research/marketing company.  In 1977 the store closed and Nan went back to work in marketing research full time.

Over the years Nan became an integral part of the Lebanon community. She was known by everyone in town.  She was very active in the Methodist church.  Her friends remained the friends she had had since high school days, with a few new ones here and there.  She has not traveled much in recent years.  Basically, except for brief excursions with her \"girl friends\" she has made her life in Lebanon serve her well. She is a strong believer in families and works hard at building that premise into all of their lives.  She was big at giving family parties to honor high school graduations, Christmas and Thanksgiving. She continued to have strong relationships with both of her brothers and their families, as well as with Old Aunt Peg and Uncle Don.  We love her much!

!NOTES:  Robert Carlton Lesan II or Buster as he is better known, was the third child of Maxine Fraser and Robert Carlton Lesan. He was a darling, chubby, blond haired child with enormous brown eyes. I remember him as the little three year old that sat rocking in a child\'s rocker singing \"Bus a damned nuisance, Bus a damned nuisance.\" When I arrived home from Hawaii in 1948 with my own baby, Bus was taking milk from a coke bottle with a nipple on it.  When I made fun of him he did not like it, so at nap time when his mother put him to bed with the coke bottle, he threw it on the floor, and never would have any thing to do with it again.

Bus attended school in Lebanon, graduating from Lebanon High School. He had lots of friends, and he was known by everyone in town.  He was never forgotten by his teachers or friends.  He went to Ohio State after high school and graduated with a Bachelors degree.  Bus was always a great discusser and arguer.  He and his friends spent many hours arguing about everything while we sat on my living room floor. Those discussions went on until the wee hours of dawn.

Bus joined the airforce after college.  His records as a pilot were outstanding.  He did his duty in Viet Nam.  His commanding officers tried to get him to sign again when his time of service expired. Once he shared all of his military records with me, and I must say I was amazed at his records.

Bus married twice.  He and Carolyn, his first wife, had no children. The marriage did not last long.  They wer divorced by the time he left the service. After the service he went to work for Burke Marketing Research Co. in Cincinnati where he met Jan.  They were married after a few years and settled down in the suberbs of Cincinnati.  There they raised three children and have lived happily.

Bus bought and ran several Hallmark stores in Cincinnati.  He is still engaged in this business.  He has had a close relationship with both Tom and Nan.[LesanRC2.FTW]

The first problem occurred when Robbie did not get good grades in school, and did not conform to the standards expected of him.  He had one interest... computers.  He went to a small college in Virginia, flunked out, and did not immediately tell his parents.  When his father learned of this, he took him to the AF recruiting office and signed him on.  His years of service as an enlisted man did not change Robbie much.  He was able to pursue his career in computer science, but up to this time he has not continued with college and may never do so.

Rob met his first wife while in the service.  Both were serving in San Antonio Texas when they married and had a little girl.  A year or so after the marriage, she left him and took Cady to North Carolina to live near her family. The divorce went on forever because Rob could not afford to pursue it, but in the meantime he met Melba Rodriquez. They had a little boy named Walker Trent Lesan.  Robbie got a better position with a computer company, and they went to Omaha to live.  On Oct. 26, 1996 Robbie and Melba decided they wanted to marry, arranged a lovely wedding and invited all the family.  Most of the family attended.  It was a wedding to make one proud.

Robbie is much loved by all the family, and everyone is pulling for him to have a happy and successful life. He and Melba have made many friends in Omaha. They have joined a church there and are very involved in the programs of the church.  In 1997, he changed jobs and went to work for another firm in Omaha.

In April 1977 Rob decided that he needed to look for another job in the computer business since he was not happy where he was working in Omaha.  He recently found a great job as a computer programer in San Antonio, TX.  He works for USAA.[LesanRC2.FTW]

!NOTES:   I have known Herb Sempsrott since I was a kid in Lebanon. He came from a big family.  His father was very, very strict, and his mother was not far behind in the discipline area.  As a child he learned to battle for his needs with all his siblings.  He grew to be what might be called a \"tough egg.\"  Pride was instilled in him.  He was taught to take care of himself and his family.  No matter about the strictness of his past he always loved and respected his parents.

Herb was married before he married Nan Lesan.  He had two children by his first wife. I had not seen him for many years after high school. He had gone to the navy during WW11 and served his time.  When the war was over he went back to Lebanon.  He worked at a number of jobs.  He was a hard worker, and always did a good job of whatever it was. Finally he and a brother opened a flooring and tiling business which became quite successful.  When his brother wanted to retire, Herb bought him out and continued the business until 1997. After the financial chrisis in the 1980s he was never able to get the business on a firm footing again, but he sure tried with Nan\'s help.

I am not sure how Herb and Nan got together. Herb was always good to Nan\'s mother, and helped Nan take care of her mother.  Shortly after the marriage he bought the old Harvey home on High St. and fixed the upper floor for an apartment for Max.  His childhood teaching never left him.  Max was part of the family, and Herb accepted responsibility for her as if she were his family.

Herb was a tough father, but like he was with his father, his children never seemed to resent his harsh punishments and strict, conservative views.

Herb\'s father was a preacher, but I never knew Herb to attend church after he left home, until Easter of 1997.  I understand he went to church that day with the entire family, and Nan introduced him in church.

Herb was and is a good guy![LesanRC2.FTW]

!NOTES:  I have personally known Sylvia since before her marriage to Tom Lesan. She was an excellent student, madly in love with Tom.  She was small of stature and had the perfect figure when I knew her years ago. She was well dressed and very attractive.  When they were married she couldn\'t \"boil water.\"  Over the years she had three children, and became a perfect wife and mother.  She took her wifely duties of an Airforce Officer seriously.  She became an excellent cook and housekeeper.  Her abilities to give a party made one wonder where she found this talent.  In her overseas years she made great homes from non existant resources.

Sylvia grew up in the Cleveland, OH.suberb of Parma.  She attended and graduated from Catholic School in that area.  Her mother and father were both born of Polish parents who were born in Poland.  They were both raised in the truly ethnic culture, as they lived in a Polish section of Cleveland until after they had children.  Sylvia\'s father was in real estate and did quite well.  Her mother was employed as a clerk in city government.  It was important to them that their children have college educations.  Syl graduated from Miami University at Oxford, Ohio with a degree in Business. To this day she has a great head for bookkeeping and finances.  She reads every newspaper from cover to cover.

When stationed in Washington, Sylvia had several positions as Executive Assistants.  When the children were grown, and Tom had retired, Syl found herself in Yuma, AZ.  She had always adjusted to living any place she had had to live while Tom was in service, but Yuma she could not learn to like.  She tried everything she could think of to become involved, but nothing she did worked.  Finally after living there for six years, they sold the house, Tom resigned from his position, they bought a house in Gilbert, AZ a suberb of
Phoenix.

We had the good fortune to visit Tom, Syl and the kids at both their German and English homes.  Syl made sure that the children were well educated and well mannered.  Aunts and Uncles were called Aunt and Uncle.  Although Syl put the Catholic faith behind her after college, her children went to church regularly with their mother and father. They are a very closely knit family, and even though the children have lives of their own now, Syl makes sure they see each other regularly.[LesanRC2.FTW]

!Notes:  I have known David since he was born.  He was a beautiful baby and much loved by his parents.  He has always had very dark thick hair and big brown eyes.  His childhood pictures are so precious that one wonders why he was he was not a child model.  David did very well in school.  He had a nice personality and lots of friends. When he graduated from high school he went to Ohio University.  After graduation he found difficulty in getting a job.  He worked for sometime for his Uncle Buster in one of his stores. He then went to Chicago with a friend.  There he got a job managing a men\'s clothing store.  He is still working there as far as I know.

In 2000 David met and married a girl from St. Charles, IL.  Reports are that they are very happy.  The wedding is reported to me that I was the only family member that did not go. It was a gala affair and everyone had a marvelous time. It is said that David and Herb cried more than any one in attendance.  Surprising the mother of the groom managed to carry through better than expected.

The bride and groom continue their lives in the Chicago area.  David is still the manager of the same store and is happy in his position.[LesanRC2.FTW]

!NOTES:  Beth has had a fantastically interesting life. After graduating from Springfield, VA High School, she attended Duke University and earned a BS with a major in Psychology.  For several years she worked in banking in the Carolinas and in Atlanta.  Then she returned to Washington D.C. jobless.  She worked at different jobs for awhile.  She was then offered a position which took her overseas, especially to all parts of USSR where she held seminars to teach the people in those countries modern banking.  Although based in D.C.  she spent more time in Europe than in the U.S.

Finally in 1994 she met Stephen Lewarne in  1994 while in Russia.  He pursued her all over the world until she finally said yes.  Her folks were happy about the marriage because they were concerned by this time that she would never marry.  With Beth\'s great personality none of the rest of the family could ever imagine her becoming an old maid. Stephen, a Canadian citizen, got his PhD in Economics at Indiana Univ.He was employed by the same company as Beth.  They were married in Canada in 1995 and went back to  central Asia where Stephen completed his contract.Stephen was employed by a Canadian Company doing oil business in Kykgystan. Beth was rehired for the same job, but could live in the new country. It was a fantastic opportunity that permitted at least two trips back to Canada a year.  Beth\'s company gave her a generous offer  so that she could carry out her wifely duties and still carry on their business in that area of the world.

In December 1966 Beth and Steve became disillusioned with their new jobs and
new home, so they both resigned  their jobs and returned to Canada shortly before
Christmas.  They rented a furnished home in Toronto where they will live until
they find jobs and a new life in Toronto. It is my understanding that the Company Stephen was working for in the middle east, did not accept his resignation.  At this time he is returning to the job sight where he was building a refinery whenever necessary.  Beth remains in Toronto with their only family so far, The Beautiful Dogs! Hopefully babies will arrive before too long.

In the summer of 1997 Stephen took a six months assignment to the government of Kazakhstan.  He will act as financial adviser to the President.  Beth will join him and stay until the end of the assignment.They took this assignment, but before long Beth returned to the states, and underwent en-vitro fertilization.  The results at the second plant resulted in triplets which were born in Canada in 2001. They are beautiful babies and very healthy.

When the triplets were about 6 months old, Stephen got a position in Washington, D.C.  Once again the family was involved in a massive move.  The house that had just been remodeled was sold, Tom and Syl helped by helping Beth to fly the infants to Phoenix and then to Washington, D.C.   Each baby had to be accompanied by an adult.[LesanRC2.FTW]

!NOTES:  Rick Lesan is the youngest child of Tom and Sylvia Lesan.  He has lived and gone to school in many places, England, Germany, California, Virginia etc.  He was a good student.  After he graduated from high school in Burkes, VA he was accepted and attended the Airforce Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  He did well as a student there.  We were fortunate to be included in the many family activities that Tom and Syl were invited to at the academy. We felt honored that we were considered. All of the aunts, uncles and cousins went to the Springs to celebrate the graduation.

Rick was sent for flight training at Williams AF base in Arizona. Since we live in Arizona, and his folks by this time were living in Yuma, we attended many things at \"Willie.\"  Rick was in the next to last class before the base was closed.  During these years Rick continued to see Jennifer McFArland, dau of Shirley and Wayne McFarland of Colorado Springs.  He had met her while at the Academy. When he came to Willie she came to Phoenix to attend ASU where she eventually got her degree.  Rick was assigned a Pilots berth at a base in California.  Rick and Jennie married in Co. Springs.  They lived at Travis AF Base for a couple of years.  Rick applied to get his Masters, was accepted, and
went to Columbia University in NYC.  They are presently tucked into a small walk up apartment with their big dog and are making do with as little as possible while Rick goes to university.  When he gets the degree he will be sent to the Airforce Academy where he will teach for a number of years.

Rick did return to the academy and as of Thanksgiving 1999 awaits the arrival of their first child, a boy.  The child is to be born in February 2000.  A new millenium child. Rick and Jenny remain in Colorado Springs, where they built their first home.  They seem a happy couple and at present do not intend to remain in Colorado Springs.[LesanRC2.FTW]

!NOTES:  I know little about Jeny.  I first met her when Rick graduated from the Academy. She was there for graduation and attended all the family affairs.  After Rick was sent to Williams Airforce Base in Phoenix, Jenny decided to go back to ASU and finish her degree there.  It was after the two spent a lot of time together in Arizona that they decided to become engaged, and arranged to have the wedding at the Chapel at Airforce Academy.
Jenny was the youngest child of her parents.  They owned a camera shop in Colorado Springs.  Her brothers and sisters live in that area, too. The wedding the kids had was beautiful.  Jeny is a tall, very thin, blond haired, blue eyed girl that looks like a model.

In 1997 while Jenny and Rick were living in NYC Jen got a job that took her to visit hotels in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Bangok. The job grew as did Jenny, and she found herself traveling the world over planning hotels for meetings for big corporations and groups.  She continued the job after she returned to their new home in Colorado Springs.  She will leave the position at the birth of her first child in Feb. 2000.[LesanRC2.FTW]

!NOTES:

My sister, Maxine Charlotte Fraser, was the first born child of Anna Cheseldine and Charles T. Fraser.  She was an attractive, popular girl.  She played the piano by ear, but learned to read music under the tutelage of Mrs. Lewis. She was a good student in school. After high School Graduation,she went to nursing school  at Miami Valley Hospital.  She became a nurse to please her grandmother Cheseldine who was a practical nurse, but she didn\'t really like being a nurse.

She graduated from the Miami Valley Hospital  School of Nursing. Dayton, Ohio in 1933. After graduation she went to New York City and worked at Gotham Hospital. She frequented a local bar where she played the piano for the customers.  It was here that she met Robert Carlton Lesan (Sonny) and married him.  After their marriage they came home for awhile and then went to live in a small apartment in Detroit.  A year or so later they were back in Lebanon where they rented an apartment, Sonny got a job with Western and Southern Life Insurance Co. and their first child, Tom, was born.

They moved to the third floor of the University Apartment across from the Warren County Court House.  Both of their other children were born while they lived there.  The children were 2 1/2 years apart.  Grandma Fraser loved this family, and she and her daughter Mabel helped the young family a great deal. Max worked a lot for Dr. Ralph Young, but not on a perminent basis.

Max and Sonny bought a small house on Highland Ave. in Lebanon.  We were excited for them.  The boys had the upstairs to themselves and Nan had her own bedroom.  Everyone was happy until one night in 1951 when Sonny fell off the fire escape  at the Elks.  He died two days later from a fractured skull. This was a crucial blow to Max.  One from which she never fully recovered.

Max had to go to work.  She got a job as a public health nurse in Warren Co. Not long after she took the job, Dr. Harvey offered her a job in his office. I took the Public Health Nurse job so she could work for Dr. Harvey.  It was difficult for Max to work and raise her children at the same time.  She was always tired, so she began to take uppers to get through the day and sleeping pills to make her sleep at night.  She often mixed alcoholic beverages with the drugs.  They didn\'t mix.  This was prior to age of drugs in this country.
Through all of Max\'s problems due to the use of drugs, her kids never deserted her which is a wonderful thing. Despite all of the problems she raised three fine kids with help from no one, other than the kids themselves. As long as Dr. Harvey practiced, Max worked for him.  By the time he retired she could no longer work. She sold her house and moved in the apartment upstairs at Nan and Herbs home.  She lived there a long time.

Max went to live at Otterbein Home in about 1975 where she was happy living in her own room.  She suffered from emphysema. but never admitted to being unable to breathe.  She would get together with the family whenever they met. She finally gave in to using a walker.  At Christmas 1994 her kids gave her a top of the line walker.  She loved it, and once again flew around Otterbein.  In 1995 she began to show symptoms of congestive heart failure and had pnuemonia several times. During the summer of 1996 she began to show other syptoms of organ shut down. Max who was ill so much of her life, lived to a a ripe old age of 84. Considering her many illnesses, and her poor state of health for so many years, it wasn\'t surprising to get a call on 16 Jan 1997 telling me that she had
quietly passed away away after eating her lunch.

I grew up with Max as my idol. I never had a chance of being much like her.  She had the looks and the figure that I could never match. She was much loved by all her friends and family. It was unbelievable how many people came to the funeral home to pay their respects.  There were so many people that she had helped when she was Dr. Harvey\'s nurse, and none of them forgot her for a moment.[LesanRC2.FTW]

Max had to go to work.  She got a job as a public health nurse in Warren Co. Not long after she took the job, Dr. Harvey offered her a job in his office. I took the Public Health Nurse job so she could work for Dr. Harvey.  It was difficult for Max to work and raise her children at the same time.  She was always tired, so she began to take uppers to get through the day and sleeping pills to make her sleep at night.  She often mixed alcoholic beverages with the drugs.  They didn\'t mix.  This was prior to age of drugs in this country.
Through all of Max\'s problems due to the use of drugs, her kids never deserted her which is a wonderful thing. Despite all of the problems she raised three fine kids with help from no one, other than the kids themselves. As long as Dr. Harvey practiced, Max worked for him.  By the time he retired she could no longer work. She sold her house and moved in the apartment upstairs at Nan and Herbs home.  She lived there a long time.

Max went to live at Otterbein Home in about 1975 where she was happy living in her own room.  She suffered from emphysema. but never admitted to being unable to breathe.  She would get together with the family whenever they met. She finally gave in to using a walker.  At Christmas 1994 her kids gave her a top of the line walker.  She loved it, and once again flew around Otterbein.  In 1995 she began to show symptoms of congestive heart failure and had pnuemonia several times. During the summer of 1996 she began to show other syptoms of organ shut down. Max who was ill so much of her life, lived to a a ripe old age of 84. Considering her many illnesses, and her poor state of health for so many years, it wasn\'t surprising to get a call on 16 Jan 1997 telling me that she had
quietly passed away away after eating her lunch.

I grew up with Max as my idol. I never had a chance of being much like her.  She had the looks and the figure that I could never match. She was much loved by all her friends and family. It was unbelievable how many people came to the funeral home to pay their respects.  There were so many people that she had helped when she was Dr. Harvey\'s nurse, and none of them forgot her for a moment."

"11922","","fitzvalley","From Louise:

Grandpa spoke of schools he had attended (graduated from ) and George followed up with those schools.  No school had listed a George Edward or Edward ever having attended, let alone graduated. 

Obviously the man attended somewhere.  He spoke 2 languages fluently - some Yiddish - some Indian dialect.  He did Math, Reading, Writing and had the training and experience to achieve his Master\'s Electrician license. 

In conversations with Dad, Grandpa spoke about being part Indian.  So I followed that route and found an Edward Valley, 25% Chippewa, electrician, on the Indian rolls, who had attended the Carlisle school in the late 1800\'s.  Carlisle didn\'t have a picture of him ......... at least not one identified as Edward Valley.  There may be group shots with him in class, etc ........... that\'s why I\'m interested of seeing Grandpa as a young man.  One day I\'d hope to drop in on Carlisle ...............got a friend there ........ or had a friend in the records department.  This Edward Valley ran away from Carlisle about the same time our Edward Valley showed up in New York. 

Indians were required to check in with the Federal Government.  The Feds lost track of their Edward Valley, electrician, in 1910 .............. suprisingly the same time our Edward Valley changed his name and got married. 

Anyway .............. The Feds show an Oliver Valley as parent of Edward  AND  lists NO MOTHER !!!!!  Curiouser and Curiouser, don\'t ya think ?  I just find that so interesting ........ you\'d think somebody could identify the PERSON who had the baby LAST not just the sperm donor. 

Grandpa had an Uncle Oliver ( with a French spelling ) in Montreal.  At the time of Grandpa\'s birth, Uncle Oliver was single and equally suprising, Sophie Valley, picked up her family in Montreal and moved to Ogdensburg ............. there are some date problems as to when Sophie actually became a widow too ......... she may have been a widow at this point. 

Sophie moved the family into the Valley Dry Goods store ( the cousin in-law\'s business ) store in Ogdensburg working as a seamstress and taking care of the Valley household as this Joseph Valley was widowed too. 

The local Catholic church in Ogdensburg has the 3 baptismal certificates Dad talked the priest into giving him.  I found Betrands in Ogdensburg and Montreal, so I asked myself the following questions, being a Math person and all. 

What are the odds of 2 separate Edward Valley\'s appearing on this planet at the same time,  with the same background, the same job, the same mystery of \"birth\" and with the same family members names, one Edward being lost to the Feds and the other reinvented in the same year, being mixed Indian blood,  and it goes on and on and on up to and including the fact my Dad went to Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania ......... the same town as Carlisle Indian School.  The odds are astronomical against there being 2 people.  Astronomical ......... there would be some chance with a population of 300 million ......doubt there was any chance in that time frame. 

Uncle George dismissed it all as speculation insisting his DAD WAS WHITE. ( when Grandpa George who first said he was Indian and he said it in reference to applying for the reparations to all Canadian Native Americans, and Grandpa NEVER screwed around or lied about money )  Coincidence,           could be, but one can deny my existence with my genetic tracer to being Native American.  ALL Native Americans and ONLY NATIVE AMERICANS have a genetic mutation which changes the retinal pettern.  I have that. 

It has to come from the Valley/Cummins line since I know where/and who the Swedes were.  They weren\'t in this country long enough and there aren\'t any babies with unknown parents. 

The Cummins, brilliant folks, were a big pain in the ass, prided themselves in keeping acurate family records ..............I think Grandma was getting old ( old for her time ) and settled on George after she \"cleaned\" him up a bit.

January 25, 1889

Mrs. Wealthy GIDEON, wife of Peter W. GIDEON, formerly of Clinton, died in Minneapolis, January 19, 1889, where she had gone for treatment of disease from which she had been suffering for a number of years.  Mrs. Gideon\'s maiden name was HULL, and she came from Madison county, Ohio, to this county with her father, Benjamin HULL, in the fall of 1847, she then being 17 years old.  Perhaps many who read this will remember her as their young teacher, as she followed teaching county schools after coming to this county until she was married to Peter Gideon, in the winter of 1848.  A few years after her marriage, and after she was the mother of three children, she moved with her family to Hennepin county, Minnesota, and settled on Lake Minnetonka, near Excelsior, where her body will repose, while we trust her spirit has returned to the God who gave it.

"11961","","fitzvalley","<div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"result_box\">&ldquo;Originating in Mortagne to the Pole, Avoiding Pierre  arrived at Canada in the current of the year 1650. Pierre Parent arrived at the  country about 1650. He worked in the Notre-Dame Seigniory of the Angels with  Beauport under the responsibility of his future father-in-law Jacques Badeau who  was a sharecropper of the Jesuits. On July 16, 1652, Jean de Lauson granted  titles of concession to ten inhabitants of the Castle-Richer. Among those Pierre  Parent (1) appears who received a batch of 4 arpents (No 77) which is located  close to the River-with-Dogs at the limit Is of Castle-Richer. It is also noted  that these colonists were probably already installed on these grounds for a  certain time to deserve these concessions. (Cf the chart of CHATEAU-RICHER IN  1680). After a stay of a few years to the Castle-Richer, and after having to  marry in Quebec on February 9, 1654, Jeanne Badeau, Avoiding fixed itself at  Beauport. It was to remain there for the remainder of its life, and y to raise  his seventeen children. Man active and not embarrassed his ten fingers, it  cumulated the occupations of farmer, stopping and merchant. As merchant, we see  it, in 1670, to sell in Quebec lime and stone. As farmer, it succeeds in in the  fourteen years space increasing of four, fifteen arpents of its ground of  Beauport, which supposed a keen work. Indeed, whereas in 1667 it had only one  quite modest concession of five arpents, we find it established in 1681 with the  head of a farm of one hundred arpents, with 18 animals with horns and 24 ewes.  But Avoiding Pierre did not stop his activities there. He was also to stop. It  was even, seems it, its principal occupation since in the instruments, it was  always mentioned as tel. This profession was rather lucrative besides, because  not only the butcher made the trade of the meat, but it also sold at handsome  prices with the tanners and the shoe-makers the calf or ox skins. Avoiding  Pierre died on August 5, 1698, and was buried the following day in the cemetery  of Beauport. Amusing detail. Avoiding Pierre who could not sign his name had  adopted like marks personal a small axe `\' chopper\'\'. This mark, let us  recognize it, did not miss originality. &ldquo; Source: Files of Quebec February 18,  2007 17:05: 05 </div>"

The first of the name on this  side of the Atlantic, Fran&ccedil;ois Dolbec, wire of Jacques and Colette Delonde, is  originating in the parish of Notre-Dame d\' Evrecy in Normandy, in the current  department of the Apple-brandy. It married Anne Masse in Quebec on August 19,  1675. Their Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois son, born in 1692, settles with  Saint-Augustin-of-Desmaures, close to Quebec, then with Holy-Anne-of-the-P&eacute;rade,  in the area of Trois-Rivi&egrave;reso&ugrave; the family remains there during three  generations. First Dolbec to be established in Saint-Eustace is fifth  generation. Charles Dolbec, wire of Charles and Marie-Queen Barrel, is born with  P&eacute;rade on November 26, 1778. He becomes merchant-general with Saint-Eustace, but  fate will be baited on him and its attempts to found a family. In November 1812,  it marries Claire Barsalou with the church of Saint-Eustace. On January 18,  1815, the latter gives rise to a fore-mentioned girl Marie-Od&eacute;lie.La mother and  the girl however will not survive a long time, since Claire Barsalou dies on  February 4, the 19 years age, and her daughter on February 19. But les&eacute;preuves  is not finished for Charles. In October 1815 it marries, always with  Saint-Eustace, Marie-Suzanne Masson, girl of Antoine and Suzanne Payfer and  sister of Joseph, who will become lord of Terrebonne. The following year,  Marie-Suzanne gives rise to a son, Jean-baptiste, who dies in 1817 at the nine  months age. She is again pregnant in 1818, but she dies in layers, with her  child. In six years, Charles thus lost two wives and four children. In December  1824, it marries Rosalie Payfer, after having obtained an exemption of  monseigneur Octave Plessis, bishop of Quebec, since this one is the cousin of  his second wife. This marriage are born Ang&eacute;lique, which will marry Doctor  Louis-Maurice the Jordan, surgeon, Louise and Charles, who will become lawyer.  In addition to being a merchant, Charles Dolbec specializes in the purchase and  the resale of potash. Extracted ashes of the stocks of trees which were cut  during the grubbing of the grounds, it was sold especially in England like  manure. The Clerc\'s Offices of the notaries of Saint-Eustace are filled with  contracts by which Charles bought potash of the farmers of the parish. July  1833, become sick, it writes its will and bequeaths its goods to his children.  It names another merchant of Saint-Eustace like executor, Jean-baptiste Proulx  says Cl&eacute;ment. When it dies in 1834, it is Proulx which goes manages its goods,  in the name of the minor heirs. In the years 1850, the children of Charles  father reach their majority and realize that Proulx wasted their fortune. Two  lawsuits are necessary, in Higher Court in 1853 then in Court of Appeal in 1856,  in order to allow Louise and Ang&eacute;lique to recover the dowry necessary to their  marriage! Charles Dolbec wire, become lawyer, is elected third mayor of the  village of Saint-Eustace in 1852 and will remain it until 1857. In 1853, it  marries &Eacute;l&eacute;onore Charon, girl of Ambroise and &Eacute;milie Paquin, with Saint-Eustace.  The couple has several girls who marry in Saint-Eustace: Marie-Louise-&Eacute;l&eacute;onore,  who marries Charles-Henri Lefebvre de Bellefeuille in 1878; Marie, who marries  Mo&iuml;se Lemire in 1891; Caroline, who marries Albert Lecavalier in 1902; and  Cecile, who marries Gaston Lefebvre de Bellefeuille in 1907. Let us note that  C&eacute;cile married the nephew of her Charles-Henri brother-in-law. The genealogical  Institute Drouin states wrongly that the families Dolbec and Delp&eacute;edit Pariseau  (become Dalp&eacute; and Parizeau) are same stock. It is a coarse error, having both of  the different ancestors. Seek and text: Marc-Gabriel Valli&egrave;res Company of  Genealogy of Saint-Eustace Collaboration Francoise Martel Turgeon </div>"

</font><br />
<span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;\">Just before noon on Saturday, I lost  my girl, our patient and your friend. I\'ve got to tell all of you....I really  don\'t know what to say....but I\'ll try. &nbsp;Since Monday, the 15th, Joni started to  cough more and it was necessary to keep her more and more sedated. This caused  her to become more and more removed. These coughing spells were very hard to  watch. Along with the above, she would become very anxious. Hospice has two  wonderful drugs to alleviate the above problems. As the week wore on, she became  less and less lucid. Saturday morning around 10, she started what they call the  &quot;death rattle.&quot; Nothing will help this. My love took her last breath about 11:50  a.m.<br />
<br />
All the kids were at her bedside, along with Alexa, our 12 year old  granddaughter. It was unbelievable. The day before, Father Ed came over and did  a beautiful prayer service for about 25 of the family. I have been crying from&nbsp;  that moment. I\'ve never known such sadness and loneliness. I know some of you  have experienced this kind of loss. I now know of what you spoke.<br />
<br />
This is  too hard. However, before I go, Joni and I do have some thanks to give. First to  our children and grandchildren. They\'ve made these last two weeks a &quot;haven of  love and support.&quot; And to the magnificent women who have ministered to  Joni...</span></p>
<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;\">On Sunday I  start a new life. To say that I\'m scared is the understatement of all time.  Please pray that I\'m up to the task. Right now, I sure have my  doubts.</span></p>
<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;\">Thanks for  listening to us these last 2 plus years. Joni was the perfect soldier. It was my  privilege and honor to serve her and act as her caregiver for 3 and a half  years.</span></p>

# Note:


    Capt. Thomas Powell was engaged in the sack and rum trade. On one of his trips from the Barbadoes, West Indies, to New York and Halifax in 1653, he stopped at Huntington Harbor, Long Island, to visit his friend, Capt. Thomas Matthews (formerly of London), who was running a boat between Huntington and Flushing, N. Y., carrying goods.

    Capt. Thomas Matthews was also a \"Cordwainer\" (shoemaker); it is presumed that Capt. Thomas Powell\'s wife had died, so he apprenticed his son, Thomas (who was at the time 12 years of age), to Capt. Thomas Matthews.

    A SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF THOMAS POWELL, 1. Bom August, 164 1; Died December 28, 172 1.

    In the whirligig of time, it is difficult to picture our pioneer settlers. They did not sit for paintings, and generally were too busy getting a living from the soil to do much writing.

    TI-ER TURMOIL OF THE CROMWELL WARS, AND THE UP-SETS OF THE. STUARTS WERE ALL BASED ON RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES.

    Many of those interested in religious questions wrote, of course, on their beliefs.

    I t was at this time that GEORGE FOX launched Quakerism, which Thomas
    Powell took up, and followed all his life.

    The Court Records of Huntington, Long Island, N. Y., next introduced THOMAS POWELL No. I to our notice as follows:

    AT A COURT HELD IN HUNTINGTON JULY 29,1662.

    Thomas Matthews, plaintiff, against Joanna Wood, widow and Administratrix to Jonas Wood.

    An action of debt for fifty-four pounds 2 shillings and two pence. Mr. John Simmons of Hempstead, appeared in the case as attorney for Joanna Wood.

    After relating the circumstances of the case Thomas Powell gave testimony in writing that \"What was in my Master\'s book--that particular about Master\'s Good Wood and Good Higbie touching the six pipes of wine and three hhds of rum,--when it was writ my Master read it to him or them and asked if it was well, and one of them answered it was. This was at Oysterbay in Daniel Whitehead\'s store.

    ~1~ LivinF with my Master almost nine years I never knew my Master\'s books question in the least.\"

    J. Matthews produced his books in Court and the case was decided in his favor.

    JAMES CHICHESTER, RICHARD WILLIAMS, THOMAS JONES, SAMUEL TITUS, Jurymen.

    Thomas Matthews sometimes called Captain Matthews was at Flushing, L. I., in 1649, trading with John Bowne delivering goods, &c. In 1659 he was bringing goods in partnership with Jonas Wood and Edward Higbie.

    He died December 7, 1686.

    In 1667 Thomas Powell was Constable, John Todd, John Rogers Overseers, for Huntington, L. 1.

    Under the Duke\'s Laws, promulgated when the English took possession in 1865, 8 Overseers were to be chosen the first year, to hold office 2 years, & 4 to be elected every two years afterwards, and a Constable was to be elected every year out of the Overseers of the previous year.

    The Constable and Overseers managed the Town affairs, and had power to make orders & rules concerning fences, highways and similar matters. Constables were to attend Courts, and they had power to arrest, those who were overtaken with strong drink, or found swearing, or Sabbath breaking, Vagrant night walkers, provided taken in sight of Constable, or proven information from others or if in beer or disorderly places.

    \"Every Constable shall have a Staff six feet long with the Kings anus on it, as a badge of his authority.\"
    The Town Court had Jurisdiction of assault, slander, and disorderly conduct generally. One offense was defined \"as giving false news and lying about another.\" The penalty was a fine of 40 shilling if Paid\" if not paid to sit in the stock or be whipped 40 strokes and give satisfaction.

    Thomas Powell was then 26 years old.

    Huntington Records show that Thomas Powell was frequently elected to fill important positions in the Township--the first of which appears to have been in 1663, when at the age of 22 he was made Recorder, this office he held most of the time for about 20 years.

    In 1666 Thomas Powell, John James, James Chichester, Ebenezer Platt, Isaac Platt, Thomas Platt, John Bailey & Jonas Wood; were Trustees of the Freeholders of the Town of Huntington, and their successors. and the Patent was issued in their names, on behalf of the Company.

    In 1684 T. Powell and one of the others were sent to Gov. Nichols, to obtain a patent from him. These patents were both at Huntington a few years since, probably are there still.

    The court consisted of a Justice of the Peace (or in his absence) Constable and two Overseers.

    Thomas Powell was Constable in 1667, 1668, 1669, had to carry a club four feet long. Appointed Surveyor 1670, to lay out land in the East Riding. Overseer 1672, 1680 &c &c.

    1686 Chosen Committee Man to go to Southampton to act with others on behalf of the Town.

    1666 Attorney for Thomas Matthews in the sale of land in Oysterbay, Joseph Ludlam, Purchaser.

    The following is on record at Huntington 1670. Whereas, Henry Whitson of Huntington, deceased in the year 1669, and after the will was proved according to law, the estate being divided by order and consent of the widow of Henry, and Thomas Whitson son of deceased, and 2d Thomas Whitson being under age,--he with the consent of his Grandfather Foster and the rest of his friends have thought good to make choice of Thomas Powell of Huntington to be his Trustee and Guardian of him the said Thomas Whitson, for the care and supervision of the Estate of him the said Thomas Whitson until he accomplish the age of one and twenty years, during which time the aforesaid, Thomas Whitson doth promise not to bargain, sell or alienate any of his Estate without the leave and consent of his said Guardian, but in all things expedient be subject to his advice and counsel, as witness my hand THOMAS WHITSON.

    In 1663, we find THOMAS POWELL was serving as Recorder and Purchasing Agent. A deed dated December 8th, 1663, gave him title to a piece of land.
    The Town Court had Jurisdiction of assault, slander, and disorderly conduct generally. One offense was defined \"as giving false news and lying about another.\" The penalty was a fine of 40 shilling if Paid\" if not paid to sit in the stock or be whipped 40 strokes and give satisfaction.

    In 1665 he was still Recroder--A Recorder\'s ftmctions must have been similar to those of Town Clerk.

    In 1667 THOMAS POWELL, served as Constable.

    In 1667 there are records of him being possessed of considerable real estate.

    In 1670, when he was 29 years of age, THOMAS POWELL 1, was chosen to lay out the lands of the town to purchasers.

    In 1678 the Council ordered the Constable and Overseers of Huntington to distrain for Church and Ministers Rates, but the order does not appear to have been attended to for several years. Thomas Powell was Overseer in 168 1. Same year we find charged against him for Ministers Rates, the following sums, viz:

    1676. 1. 15. 00. 1679. 1. 10. 09. 1677. 1. 13. 03. 1680. 1. 02. 05. 1678. 1. 09. 06. 1681. 10 04. 11. Altogether L8. 15. 10. THOMAS POWELL, being a devout Quaker, he reftised to pay Church taxes, which under the British law was compulsory for the support of the Church of England.

    He consistently reftised to pay them and he was ordered by a Writ from the King to appear at Court at Riverhead, to show cause, why they should not be taken from him by force.

    There does not appear to be any record of a settlement of the claim in any manner, and is SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SO LIKED BY HIS NEIGHBORS AND ASSOCIATES, THAT THE AUTHORITIES LET THE CASE DROP.

    In 1682, he refused TO SERVE LONGER AS CONSTABLE, BECAUSE, IT WAS NECESSARY TO TAKE AN OATH, WHICH THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS OPPOSED THEN, AS T14EY DO TODAY.

    Meantime Thomas Powell sold his property in Huntington and bought a large tract of wilderness, of the Marsapaque Indians, called it Bethpage, took possession in 1688, built a house for his eldest son, Thomas.

    Thomas Powell got his deed from the Indians in 1695, and has been said sold one third to T. Whitson in 1700. Thomas Powell purchased a second plot of the Indians in 1699. The Deeds are both Recorded at Jamaica.

    The following is a copy of the boundaries of the two purchases, with the names and marks of Indians who made the sale.

    1695. We Marinus, Sowamicus, Wm. Choppy, and others for cc 140, sold to Thomas Powell Sen., land Beginning at the west Comer, at a dirty hole upon the brushy

"14277","NI1963","fitzvalley","Isaac Griffin, a son of tavern keeper Samuel Griffin and his wife Martha, was born February 27, 1751, in Duck Creek Hundred, Kent County, Delaware.  This was near the present town of Smyrna.  He grew into 
an imposing figure of a man--six feet two inches tall, physically powerful, black hair, very dark complexion, deep blue eyes, and features of the Roman type.  generally he was modest and retiring, but had something of a reckless disposition, and he was quick to resent an insult.

When Isaac was eighteen he inherited 177 pounds from his father, a considerable sum in those days.  He appears to have used it wisely, acquiring land in the area.  In 1774 he had won the heart of a young Quakeress, names Mary Morris, whose family Were strict Friends.  She was locked in a room upstairs to prevent her union with the young worldling.  He found out the situation, obtained a ladder, put it to the window, and she climbed down and eloped with him.  A meeting of the Friends was called, when she was notified that, \"If thee will say thee is sorry that thee married Isaac, thee can stay in.\"  But as she would not say it, she was expelled from their membership.  Mary was a daughter of James and Ann (Tilton) Morris of Duck Creek Cross Roads, and was born on July 28, 1756.

In January 1776 Isaac enlisted in the Continental army, for one year, in Colonel Haslet\'s regiment, 1st Company, Captain John Patten.  He went into active Service in August, and was under fire several times.  He re-enlisted for the duration of the war.  During his service he was mainly instrumental in capturing the leader of a group of Tories, Cheney Clow.  The adherents of Clow hated Griffin intensely, and after the close of the war his personal safety was endangered.

Isaac, like the rest of his family at that time, was a slave owner.  He must have still felt some Quaker influence, for it is recorded in the manumission book of the Friends\' Meeting of Duck Creek December 23, 1782 that he freed his slaves.

In October 1783 he had his first recorded brush with politics. At a general election held at Duck Creek Cross Roads some former Tories who had not taken the oath of allegiance were allowed to vote.  Members on the Griffin family objected strongly, and in the resulting disorderly and Violent proceedings a box containing the votes was carried away.

His enemies constantly harassing him, Isaac Began investing in land in Fayette County, Pennsylvania with the intention of Moving.  The Indians still lingering near, his wife feared to move, so he sold the land.  Later, however, she relented, although she had lost her health, and he eventually bought several farms in Fayette County.  By 1794 they were established in their new home, and he was appointed Justice of the Peace.  He served in this capacity for several years.  In 1807 he was elected to the State Legislature, and was re-elected until he had served four successive terms.  In 1812 he was elected to Congress.  It is related of him that upon being notified of this election he brought cloth of home manufacture to Thomas Williams, Esq., of New Geneve, for the purpose of having his make him a suit of clothes.  He informed the persons present that \"he raised the sheep, carded, spun, dyed and wove the cloth on his premises.\"  Also in this year a gloom was cast over the family when his favorite son, Jam"

Ronald (Babe) came to California when he was 19 with two of his frien ds
from Indiana.  They went to Whittier CA where his friends stayed.  Dad
wanted to live in the country and be a cattle rancher so he headed for
Lancaster CA where he met Frances Rauch, his wife for nearly 41 years.
After he and Frances were married they went to Bloomingdale Ind to li ve,
but when they found that they were about to become a family, they ret urned
to Lancaster CA to stay and raise their 5 children.  Four of which we re
born in and around Lancaster.  The first three were born in Dr. Savag e\'s
Hospital in Town and Becky at home out in the old Tierra Bonita distr ict,
out east of town.
He missed WW 1 as he was too young, and WW 2 because he was too old .  So
he spent the war building B17\'s at Lockheed in Burbank CA where he wo rked
from 1942 until his heart attack in 1958, after which he retired an d helped
Frances with her Amway business. The Swaim family moved from Lancaste r CA
in Dec 1934 to Venice CA Then to Santa Maria in the spring of 1935, i n the
fall of 1935 we moved to Santa Monica.  During this time he and his f ather-
in-law, N H Rauch and his brother-in-law, George Rauch formed a Compa ny to
sell wood.  Babe cut, the reason for moving up to Nipomo, near Sant a Maria.
George drove the truck to haul the wood to LA and N.H. found the cust omers
and sold the wood.  Because of Mother\'s health in Santa Monica, and a lso
because I was coughing and unable to go to school, dad sold out and w e moved
to AZ.  My cough cleared up within a week and was able to start schoo l again
and it was dicovered that mother\'s illness was caused by her heart no t by the
climate.  We moved to AZ in Feb of 1937 and moved back to CA in Marc h to
Tarzana then we moved to the West Adams district of LA about Nov 193 7 because
it was to far for dad and grandpa to drive in to work every day.  Ou r grand-
parents were living with us because of mother\'s health and dad was no w working
for his father-in-law and brother-in-law.  During the summer of 193 8 we moved
to Culver City over the store which was now called R & S Feed & Fuel.
Easter Vacation of 1939 mother was now strong enough to care for us s o we
moved back to Lancaster where dad got a job working a ranch in the De l Sur
district where I finished grammer school and started hi\'school.  We m oved into
town, Lancaster before school started in fall with dad working fo r a farm
equipment Co.  The pay was not very good so in Dec 1940 we moved bac k to
Culver City and dad went back to work driving a truck for R & S  an d then
for Northern & Western Transportation Co\'s.  With the war starting i n Dec 1941
dad got a job with Lockheed and we moved again this time to North Hol lywood
where mom and dad lived until they moved to Poway CA about 1962.
While he was working at Lockheed he suffered a major heart attack i n 1958
which forced his retirement.  The attack was caused by working in th e fuel
tanks of a jet.  The fumes burned his lungs which caused blood clout s to
form and enter his blood stream causing an aneurysm to form near hi s heart.
This caused his death in 1965.

Frances lived in Fulton Co. Ill until she was about ten, then, because
her father had TB the family sold their farm and moved to a cattle
ranch in Colorado Springs CO where the family lived until about 1920
when her parents went broke and left to live in Pueblo CO.  From there
the family, which was really hard up by this time, built a canvas
house on the back of an old flat bed truck and traveled to Yuma AZ,
from there they traveled across the old plank road into California
and ended up in San Fernando CA where Grandfather found a job working
for a turkey ranch about 60 miles away in the Antelope Valley.
Here Grandfather was able to get ahead enough to homestead a ranch in
the Tierra Bonita district east of Lancaster.  This is where France s met
Babe(Ronald) Swaim.  After I was born, Babe & Frances lived and dad w orked for his father-in-law until after Ronald Jr. was born. Then w e moved to another ranch near-by called Avreys.  From there we move d to McDonald\'s
ranch and then to the dairy where dad drove the milk truck until we
moved to Venice CA in Dec 1934.  Early in 1935, in Feb. I think, we m oved up to Nipoma, near Santa Maria, where dad cut wood for George t o haul to LA for Grandpa Rauch to sell.  Ronald Jr and I finished th e school year there, then  we moved back to Santa Monica in late Aug . or first of Sept. and I, Ronald, and Richard started school at McKi nley.  We stayed there with Granddad, George, and Babe in the wood bu siness.  We stayed there from Sept. 1935 until Feb.1937 when we move d to AZ because the doctor thought mother had TB.  Uncle Arthur and h is family moved to Nipoma to cut the wood, with Daddy driving the tru ck.  We only lived in AZ one month as the doctors over there said mot her had had a heart attact due, I think to stress, so we were able t o move back to CA and Daddy back to working with George & Grandpa i n the wood business, but now he was no longer a pardner, but an emplo yee.

William Polk Cummins, born on April 19, 1853, was the son of David J. Cummins (1824-1898), a prominent Delaware businessman and landowner, and Juliet Polk Cummins, daughter of William Polk of Odessa. A native of Smyrna, Delaware, William Cummins had a brother, Albert W. Cummins, who would later work for The Wilmington Morning News, and four sisters: Mrs. Henry Lee, Mrs. Edith Davis, Agnes Cummins, and Susan Cummins. He attended Princeton College, graduating from that institution in 1875, and immediately set out to work in the agricultural industry. Working independently as the manager of Glenfern Farm and involved in the manufacturing of drain tiles and fertilizers, he decided to take on John Cosgriff as a partner in 1884. This partnership lasted some ten years until the death of William Cummins, after which Cosgriff went on to create his own company, Cosgriff, Beck & Hazel, which dealt in the manufacturing of fertilizers as well.
Cummins was quite well-connected, and was an active member of his community. Indeed, in the words of the Wilmington Evening Journal, he was a \"prominent Northern Kent Citizen.\" He married Sarah Esther Williams (1855-1900), daughter of the Delaware state senator James Williams, who was also president of Parvis & Williams. Cummins himself held a place on the Delaware State Central Committee, and for six years served as Director of the National Bank at Smyrna. He traveled frequently on business -- to Wilmington, Philadelphia, or Maryland -- and maintained a wide range of personal contacts. In addition, he was treasurer and choirmaster of St. Paul\'s Episcopal Church in Smyrna.
 
In 1893 his health began to fail, and in that year he and his wife moved from Glenfern to Smyrna as a result. He had been suffering from kidney problems and heart disease, which prevented him from engaging in the level of activity he had once been used to, and on March 17, 1895 he died in his home.

"14340","NI2689","fitzvalley","Adopted in Ogdensburg, but birth location officially unknown.  Oliver Valley in Montreal had a son named Edward with the same birth date, and Oliver was living with or near Sophia at the time.
From Louise:
 
Grandpa spoke of schools he had attended (graduated from ) and George followed up with those schools.  No school had listed a George Edward or Edward ever having attended, let alone graduated.  
 
Obviously the man attended somewhere.  He spoke 2 languages fluently - some Yiddish - some Indian dialect.  He did Math, Reading, Writing and had the training and experience to achieve his Master\'s Electrician licens
 
In conversations with Dad, Grandpa spoke about being part Indian.  So I followed that route and found an Edward Valley, 25% Chippewa, electrician, on the Indian rolls, who had attended the Carlisle school in the late 1800\'s.  Carlisle didn\'t have a picture of him ......... at least not one identified as Edward Valley.  There may be group shots with him in class, etc ........... that\'s why I\'m interested of seeing Grandpa as a young man.  One day I\'d hope to drop in on Carlisle ...............got a friend there ........ or had a friend in the records department.  This Edward Valley ran away from Carlisle about the same time our Edward Valley showed up in New York. 
 
Indians were required to check in with the Federal Government.  The Feds lost track of their Edward Valley, electrician, in 1910 .............. suprisingly the same time our Edward Valley changed his name and got married.  
 
Anyway .............. The Feds show an Oliver Valley as parent of Edward  AND  lists NO MOTHER !!!!!  Curiouser and Curiouser, don\'t ya think ?  I just find that so interesting ........ you\'d think somebody could identify the PERSON who had the baby LAST not just the sperm dono
 
Grandpa had an Uncle Oliver ( with a French spelling ) in Montreal.  At the time of Grandpa\'s birth, Uncle Oliver was single and equally suprising, Sophie Valley, picked up her family in Montreal and moved to Ogdensburg ............. there are some date problems as to when Sophie actually became a widow too ......... she may have been a widow at this point. 
 
Sophie moved the family into the Valley Dry Goods store ( the cousin in-law\'s business ) store in Ogdensburg working as a seamstress and taking care of the Valley household as this Joseph Valley was widowed too.  
 
The local Catholic church in Ogdensburg has the 3 baptismal certificates Dad talked the priest into giving him.  I found Betrands in Ogdensburg and Montreal, so I asked myself the following questions, being a Math person and all.  
 
What are the odds of 2 separate Edward Valley\'s appearing on this planet at the same time,  with the same background, the same job, the same mystery of \"birth\" and with the same family members names, one Edward being lost to the Feds and the other reinvented in the same year, being mixed Indian blood,  and it goes on and on and on up to and including the fact my Dad went to Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania ......... the same town as Carlisle Indian School.  The odds are astronomical against there being 2 people.  Astronomical ......... there would be some chance with a population of 300 million ......doubt there was any chance in that time frame. 
 
Uncle George dismissed it all as speculation insisting his DAD WAS WHITE. ( when Grandpa George who first said he was Indian and he said it in reference to applying for the reparations to all Canadian Native Americans, and Grandpa NEVER screwed around or lied about money )  Coincidence,           could be, but one can deny my existence with my genetic tracer to being Native American.  ALL Native Americans and ONLY NATIVE AMERICANS have a genetic mutation which changes the retinal pettern.  I have that. 
 
It has to come from the Valley/Cummins line since I know where/and who the Swedes were.  They weren\'t in this country long enough and there aren\'t any babies with unknown parents.  
 
The Cummins, brilliant folks, were a big pain in the ass, prided themselves in keeping acurate family records ..............I think Grandma was getting old ( old for her time ) and settled on George after she \"cleaned\" him up a bit.  "

"14416","NI01879","fitzvalley","ABRAM DE LA MONTAGNE, fourth son of Jan La Montagne, Jr., but oldest son of his second wife Maria Vermilye, was baptized on 16 March 1664 in the New Harlem Dutch Church.  He was clearly named for his uncle Abram Vermilye who had been killed just months earlier in the relief of Wiltwyck.  At the baptism, his sponsors were his uncle Willem de la Montagne, his grandmother Jacomina Jacobs (Vermilye), and Gerrit Van Trieht.

Abram was just eight years old when his father died.  He was apprenticed to be a weaver and must have been a good weaver, since he afterwards gave instruction in that craft to other young men of the town.  He was the only son of Jan La Montagne, Jr., who stayed in New Harlem all of his life, farming and plying his craft.

On 27 March 1689, he married Rebecca Van Huyse, daughter of Theunis Idens Van Huyse and his wife Jannetie Thyssen (Van Pelt).  Theunis Van Huyse was the owner of a large farm in Harlem, along the North River between present-day 89th and 107th Street, a area which was known as Bloomingdale.  Rebecca had been born at New Utrecht, probably about 1670.  Theunis Van Huyse spent his early days on Long Island, although it is probable that he was born in Holland in 1639, the son of Ide Van Huyse and Teuntje Teunis of Nordingen. 

It seems likely that Ide Van Huyse died in Holland and Teuntje Teunis came to New Amsterdam as a widow.  She married second husband Jacob Hellakers in New Amsterdam.  Jacob Hellakers was a strong member of the Labadist movement, and Jasper Danckers and Peter Sluyter, Labadist travelers, stayed with Teuntje and Jacob Hellakers in 1679 in New York City. In his Journal Jasper Danckers described his hosts and their children.  In his account of Theunis Idens, Dancker takes credit for reforming a reckless and irresponsible youth.  Theunis became a member of the Dutch Church and of the Labadist movement on 17 June 1680 and thereafter became a pillar of the community.

Abram’s mother, Maria Vermilye, died just six months after Abram’s marriage, leaving her house and lot in the village of Harlem to him.  Abram’s rights as a patentee of New Harlem were by virtue of this freehold and upon this he drew lot #23 in 1691, which was five morgen now within Manhattan’s Central Park.  The west side of his grant lay next to the lands of his father-in-law, Theunis Van Huyse, and Abram added to his lands by judicious exchanges with Samuel Waldron and Barent Waldron.

However, Abram evidently felt he also possessed the “morgen right” held by his father in the undivided common land, even though his father had sold his farm to Jan Louwe Bogert.  Abram first raised the question in a letter to the Overseers of New Harlem in 1700, a letter that Bogert found so disturbing that he eventually sold the land.  At last in 1723, the matter came to court and the court found against Abram.

The town records of Harlem show that Abram was a constable in 1694, a collector in 1702, and surveyor of highways in 1704 and 1707.  The census of 1703 of Harlem showed Abram [unfortunately transcribed as Saml instead of Abrm in the printed version of that census] with six sons and two daughters.

In his old age, Theunis Van Huyse had his farm laid off in lots of 57 ½ acres each, and he and Jannetie conveyed these parcels to their children, including Rebecca Delamontanie, giving possession by “turf and twig” on 22-23 June 1720.

Rebecca must have died about 1725.  After that date her sons left Harlem and scattered into New Jersey and upstate New York.

In 1729 Abram sold his land to his brother-in-law, George Dyckman, who owned an adjoining part of the old Van Huyse farm.  In 1733, Abram was still living, with a second wife Aeltje Hoogland.  

Abram’s grave was in the old Harlem graveyard, beneath a rough stone inscribed A.L.M., 12 Feb 1733/34.  

No will has been found in New York or New Jersey for Abram, but there is a docket in the colonial papers of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, in which Isaac, Edward [Ide], and Joseph Montanye bring suit in 1744 against Matthew Benson of Hackensack, New Jersey,  for debts owned to Abraham Montanye, in their capacity as executors of the last will and testament of said Abraham.  Matthew Benson moved to Hackensack in 1731 from Harlem, while Abram was still alive.  Since only two of Abram’s children are recorded in the baptismal records of Harlem, it would be extremely helpful if we could find a copy of Abraham’s last will and testament.  Based on New Jersey records and patterns of family association, there are ten known children of Abram and Rebecca (Van Huyse) Delamontanie.  This order of birth may not be correct but the place of these descendants in this family becomes more and more certain as evidence continues to mount.

"14417","NI01995","fitzvalley","JOSEPH DELAMONTANIE, son of Abram Delamontanie and his wife Rebecca Van Huyse, was born in Harlem, New York City, New York, between 1695 and 170

Unfortunately, because there is no baptismal record to be found for this Joseph in the surviving records of the Reformed Dutch Church of New York, many descendants have followed red herrings and tried to make a case for being descended from other Joseph Montanyes of the same period for whom there are extant baptismal records.  The other Josephs, however, lived and died in New York City.  They have no descendants today.  Joseph, son of Jan Montanye and Annetje Waldron,  who married Margrietje Roll, disappears from the record books thereafter.  Joseph, son of Jesse Montanye and Gerritje Yates, never married and died in New York City in January 1756, according to the records of the Reformed Dutch Church.

Joseph Delamontanie, known in early New Jersey records as Yost Montanje, moved to the Peapack Patent of New Jersey around 1725, in company with brothers Teunis, Ide (Edward), and Nicholas.  Both Edward and Joseph farmed land in the same general area, but Edward’s land eventually was in Somerset County, while Joseph’s land was in Morris County.  Teunis went into the shipping and importing business, while Nicholas is still a very shadowy figure, farming in Somerset County up through the 1740s but not found thereafter.  However, they all appear as related men in the accounts of Jacob Janeway, storekeeper at Bound Brook, between 1735-1745.

About 1731, Joseph married Maria Covert, daughter of Jan Teunissen Covert and Jeanne Brokaw, both from well-known Huguenot families of Newtown, Long Island, who became important landowners on the Peapack Patent.  Maria Covert was baptized on 6 August 1706 in the Raritan RDC; witnesses were Cornelis and Neeltien Teunissen.  There is no record of the marriage of Joseph and Maria, but the names of their children and their patterns of association make Maria’s identification quite certain.  

Their oldest child was baptized in 1732 in the North Branch (Readington) RDC, but the younger children were baptized at the Raritan (Somerville) RDC.  There is no known birth record for the middle three children.

Joseph was called Yost and Yeost in Andrew Johnston’s Journals, published in the Somerset County Historical Quarterly.  George Leslie of Perth Amboy, New Jersey, a proprietor of land on the Peapack Patent, leased 205 acres of land to Joseph Montanye in 1749 and eventually sold him the same land in 1753, after it was surveyed by Andrew Johnston.  His closest neighbors were Peter, Bout, and Andries Wortman, while Andrew and Morris Bird were weavers who lived on his land.

New Jersey Supreme Court Record #25222 is a complaint of trespass brought by Joseph Montanye at Roxbury, Morris County, New Jersey, on 23 March 1764, against Joseph Folkerson, who on 1 August 1763 did break and enter the property of Joseph Montanye and did take down and carry away twenty panels of Worm Fence worth ten pounds.  David Ogden acted as attorney in the suit which asked for thirty pounds damages.

Tax lists for 1779 and 1780 show Joseph, along with his sons John, Abraham, and Burgun, and his grandson Abraham Junior, in Roxbury Township, Morris County, New Jersey.  Another son, Joseph, was taxed in Walpack Township, Sussex County, in 1773.

It is, of course,  possible that there were two cousins who married two different  men named John Little/Littel. It is also possible that there was just one Montanye girl from New Jersey who married a John Littel from New Jersey.  

John and Ann Montanye Little were in Charleston,  Montgomery County, New York, in 1804 when they signed the quit claim on the land  in Bridgewater Township, Somerset County, New Jersey, where Ann\'s deceased father, Edward Montanye, had farmed.  They had moved to Montgomery County, New York,  before 1800 with many neighbors and family members from Pluckemin, Somerset County, New Jersey.  They migrated to Canada in the 1820s.  "

The Deacon was a lithe, active, little man, and his cousin, a big stout man, so to distinguish them, one was called little Teeple and the other big Teeple.

\"The Baptist Church at Aylmer dates back to 1810, when the few settlers congregated at Deacon William Teeple\'s or at Deacon William Davis\'s.  The settlement grew as new settlers arrived and it became imperative that more suitable accommodation must be provided.  Isaac Ostrander provided the land at Rogers\' Corners and Deacon Teeple and Deacon Davis provided the lumber. The church was also used as a school and continued there for 28 years.  In 1844 a large Frame church was erected in Aylmer on the site of the present fine brick edifice, which was constructed in 1871.

Her parents and her birth date were given in the baptismal records, as they were compiled by the DAR in Cemetery, Church, and Town Records, Vol. 35, page 132,  typescript located at the New York State Library in Albany.

Family sources in the Mohawk Valley noted that Sarah married Mr. Topping, and some researchers have assumed that she married Jared Topping who does appear in the U.S. Census of 1810, 1820, 1830, and 1840 in the Town of Charleston, Montgomery County, New York.  However, Topping researchers note that Jared Topping (1774-1847) married Sarah Leek (1781-1848), not Sarah Teeple.

Information from John Lindberg on the Topping Genforum: 
\"According to TOPPING GENEALOGY by Charles Topping and Grace Topping Fritsch (Gateway Press, Baltimore, 1980) page 210:   Elijah Herrick Topping born Mar 25, 1825 at Charleston, NY, was the son of Jared (1774-1847) and Sarah (Leek) Topping (1781-1848). Jared & Sarah had 14 children.\"

Several of Sarah Teeple Topping\'s brothers and sisters migrated to the Elgin area of Ontario, Canada, after the death of their father in 1810, so it is possible that her family is one of the Topping families that also can be found in Canada.

Rhoda Biggs, 1772: Worked pocketbook - double form
(5/12/02) - Worked or needlework pocketbooks were popular from 1740 until 1790, with the fashion reaching its peak between 1760 and 1780. Men, as well as women, carried them. Worked pocketbooks were made in two shapes: the single envelop and the double form that folded in the center with equal size divisions on each side. The most popular stitch was the Irish Stitch in a Flame Design, which is the stitch used in Rhoda Biggs\' pocketbook.

Rhoda Biggs\' pocketbook is in the collection of the Clinton County Historical Society, and we would like to thank Ann Florea Larrick (Rhoda\'s GGGG Granddaughter) for providing us with the progression of this pocketbook through the family.

Rhoda Casto Biggs (Mrs. Daniel Biggs) was born in 1730 in Salem, New York, the daughter of Elizabeth Abbott Casto and William Casto.

Rhoda Casto Biggs gave the pocketbook to her son, William Biggs (1759 - 6/28/1828) who gave it to his daughter, Charlotte Biggs Athey (5/9/1823 - 3/2/1901) who gave it to her daughter, Nancy Maria Athey Florea (7/19/1841 -12/26/1926) who gave it to her son, Franklin Arthur Florea (1/18/1871 - 9/29/1919) who gave it to his son Alpha M. Florea (3/1/1899 - 9/5/1945) gave it to his daughters: Carolyn Florea Casson (b. 10/25/1926), Ann Florea Larrick (b. 8/19/1929), Elnora Florea Torres (b. 4/1/1934) and Mildred Florea Curry (9/18/1937 - 3/18/2002).

Grandson Ragnvald-80 lists the birthplace as Haa, Jaederen, Kristiansand, Norway.  (Lois Thorstenson-82 (A-004) relates that the Aanestad area is south of Stavager, near the town of Varhaug. Descendants of Mathias, Helge\'s brother, still live on the old homestead near Varhaug.)

PROBLEM: In (A-020-O) Henrietta lists the b. place as Haa Prestegjaeld, Norway.  A-043 lists Hå, Jaederen, Norway.

A-047 lists HÅ, Jæren, Norway. (HÅ is a larger area, similar to a county, Jæren is a district in HÅ and Varhaug is a town adjacent to Ånestad both within these larger areas. I am using the data from A-047.

NOTE: In 1994, my wife Dorothy and I, brother Sam and Susan visited the Aanestad area in Norway.  On the road heading south from Stavanger, and just before arriving at Varhaug is a sign pointing to Ånestad.  It is a collection of farms all by the same name located between two rivers.

Halvard Aanestad, who we visited in Varhaug took us out to the farm in Ånestad on which his half-brother, Svien and his wife, Olaug were still living and farming.

At this time, Svien was remodeling the old farmhouse because his son, Morten (a newspaper reporter) and his wife Kristin were in the process of moving onto the farm and Svien and Anne were planning on retiring to a new house in a new housing development near the edge of the farm.

We also visited this new house.  The craftsmanship and wood interiors of both were simply beautiful.  My outstanding memory of the new house was a walk-in refrigerator!  Hanne Brit Sandsmark, who wonderfully compiled the Norwegian and American names into a published genealogy lives just up the road on the way to Stavanger. Our time was limited by the departure of our cruise ship so we were unable to try to see her and her family.  Our immigrant ancestor, Helge (my great grandfather) was a brother of Karl (Hanna\'s great-grandfather) and also a brother of Mathias (Hallvard\'s grandfather).  Hallvard is an electrical contractor in Vaurhaug.  We had a very enjoyable meeting in his home and Mary served us lunch including lefse and we were made to feel very welcome.  Hallvard explained that Aa or Å indicates a relative size of the area of land bordered by two rivers, so Aanestad gets its name from that idea.  Interestingly, Hallvard spells it Aanestad while Svien spells it Å.  Both continue to insist they have the preferred spelling!"

"14444","","fitzvalley","Shortly after the FORTUNE arrived at Plymouth in 1621, a shallop from the ship SPARROW, which Had arrive in Damaris Cove.  In this little vessel were ten men, who came to select a site for another plantation; Phineas Pratt was one of them, Joshua Pratt, probably the brother of Phineas, and like him, unmarried, arrived at Plymouth in the ANNE in the summer of 1623.  Most of those who came in thes ship and in the LITTLE JAMES were friends and relatives of the Plymouth settlers.  During the year 1623 there was a division of the land at Plymouth, under three groups: those who came in the MAY FLOWER, those who came in the FORTUNE, and those who came in the  ANNE.  As part of the last group, Phineas and Joshua received two acres.  Since Phineas did not come by any of those vessels, the probability is that he was the brother of Joshua and put with that group to make the division complete.  In 1624 the settlers of Plymouth were divided into twelve companies of thirteen persons each.  Joshua and Phineas were assigned to Francis Cooke.

He was appointed a surveyor on January 3, 1627, along with William Bradford, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Francis Cooke and Edward Bangs.  He was mentioned in the cattle division of June 1, 1627, when he was a member of Francis Cooke\'s company which received \"the least of the four black heifers came in the JACOB.\" He was a freeman at the time of the incorporation of Plymouth in 1633, and in April of that year he was foreman of the jury, as well as Constable in 1633, 1636, 1637.  On December 4, 1638 he was again sworn in as Constable and the Court gave him the duties of measuring lands and the sealing of weights and measures.

"14512","","fitzvalley","<b>Life & times of Isaac Bennett after moving to New York from Pennsylvania. </b>

He moved from Brothersvalley, Pennsylvania after 1804 and is found in Medina, New York in 1809.

Aquilla Bennett Sr. told to his grandson, George Albert Bennett that:

?As a young child, he boiled salt in kettles with his father, Isaac Bennett, in Medina Twp, Orleans Co., NY. ?

Isaac\'s first attempt in the making of ?White Gold? (salt) was in 1813, but the enterprise was not sucessful. In 1818 he came into possesion of a unprofitable saltworks from the Holland Land Company. From 1818 to 1823, Isaac & family were in the business of salt production. Since Aquilla mentioned boiling the salt, it would make sense that Isaac\'s other son\'s, Jacob & Jesse also had a hand in this line of work. This saltworks was located on the east bank of Oak Orchard Creek in Oak Orchard village. Here he sunk a well 150 feet into the ground & found a good brine, which could be boiled down to get the salt. 

He then contracted Israel & Seymour Murdock to furnish him with 64 kettles, which they acquired in Utica, NY and had shipped by lake, to the mouth of Oak Orchard creek. The Murdock boys then hired several teams to bring the heavy kettles to the works, arriving one day before Isaac\'s stipulated delivery date, once delivered they received their pay in gold. (By the end of this business venture Isaac had upwards of 70 kettles boiling.)

Making salt it seems was a labor intensive, dangerous & mundane job. After drawing the brine water to the surface it was emptied into the large boiling kettles, (some possibly set out in large bowls in the sun to evaporate). Men stood over the kettles, stirring the fetid smelling water with long wooden paddles. While this may sound like a hot job it was also very dangerous! Mention is made of men being severly scaled by the boiling brine and worse, falling in the huge kettles which ultimately led to their deaths. 

Issac sold his salt for between $5-$10 a barrel ( $10 in 1825 had the same buying power as $217.90 current dollars) It appears then that Isaac was a fairly wealthy man, since it is stated about his saltworks: ?furnishing a large portion of all the salt used in this portion of the country.? 

Isaac a wise businessman, could see the handwriting on the wall with the building of the Erie Canal. Once the Erie Canal was complete, salt could be shipped from Salina (now Syracuse) and purchased for a much cheaper price, which in turn would hurt his profits. He decided to sell his business in 1823 to Henry Boardman, who abandoned the business once the canal was completed.

There is much more to be found about Isaac Bennett. There is much documentation that shows he also amougst other ventures, made a pretty good living buying and selling very large tracts of land in Pennsylvania, West Virginia & New York. We think that he died around 1835 in New York....

Written by Lisa Hoffius. A huge Thanks goes to cousin David Sidney Bennett (Maryland) also a descendant of Isaac Bennett. After David\'s father passed away last year, he came into possesion of many notes written by his ancestors, leading to the discovery of where Isaac Bennett wandered off to after his years in Brothersvalley Twp., Somerset Co., PA.

ISAAC B. CRAMLET

Isaac B. Cramlet, the son of Mr. and Mrs. George Cramlet, was born November 22, 1844 at Chanlersville, Ohio, and died at his home in Mt. Ayr, Iowa, Jan. 14, 1921 at the age of 76 years, 1 month and 23 days.

He is survived by his widow, Mrs. Maggie M. Cramlet and eleven children: Charlie of Winterset; George, of Appleton, Minn., John, of Burnett, Wis.; Mrs. Anna Bennett, of Benson, Minn.; Mrs. Cora Kopp of Deer Creek, Minn.; Mrs. Myrtle Bush of Macon, Mo.; Mrs. Pearl Bush of Winterset; Frank of Appleton, Minn.; Edwin of Fairmont, Minn.; William of Mt. Ayr, Iowa and Robert Cramlet Clearwater the adopted son of Mr. and Mrs. John Clearwater of Salem, Ore. There are also 38 grandchildren and two great grandchildren to mourn his loss.

Mr. Cramlet was reared in Ohio until 1862 when at the age of 18 he enlisted in the Union forces for service during the civil war, serving one year and one month. He was honorably discharged in September, 1863, on account of disability. After leaving the army, he came west to Rushville, Ill., where he resided on a farm until 1879.

In 1868 he was married to Ellen Cornman and to this union were born 17 children. In 1896 the family contracted typhoid fever, the mother and two children passing away at the home near Winterset. He was remarried to Maggie Carnahan at Winterset, May 30, 1897. Two children, Everett and Eva, were born of this marriage, but passed away in infancy.

Mr. and Mrs. Cramlet moved to Mt. Ayr during the spring of 1900, where they have since resided. Mr. Cramlet was a member of Ellis G. Miller Post, No. 96, G.A.R. of Mt. Ayr. During the last two years, he has had failing health, but was confined to his bed only for the last few days, having contracted a severe cold, which developed into pneumonia, from which he never rallied, although he was conscious until the last.

Visitation is 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and noon until the conclusion of the 5 p.m. vigil Sunday, all at Michelotti-Sawyers Mortuary. Funeral Mass is 11 a.m. Monday at St. Pius X Church, with visitation at the church an hour prior to the service. Cremation will follow the service. Burial of ashes with military honors will take place Tuesday at Calvary Cemetery in Billings.

Terry was born July 27, 1930, the youngest child of Robert L. and Grace Fitzgerald West. As pioneers of Sheridan County in 1907, Robert and Grace raised 10 children on a farm south of present-day Outlook. Terry attended school in Outlook through the eighth grade, and in 1948 graduated from Assumption Abbey High School in Richardton, N.D.
He served in the Air Force from 1950 to 1954 as a weatherman in the United States and Greenland. Upon returning to Montana in 1954, Terry married Donna M. Clay of Plentywood on Aug. 9, 1954, and they settled together in Outlook to raise their family.

In 1956, Terry was appointed a rural mail carrier in Outlook, transferring to Joliet, Mont., in 1982. He retired from there Sept. 30, 1988, after 39 years of service.
Terry was very proud of his Irish roots and growing up in Outlook, where he was an avid fan of the Outlook Blue Jays. He loved his family and children and instilled in them a solid work ethic, strong moral character and a fantastic sense of humor. This was expressed at family gatherings, where you would find Terry singing songs around the fire and amusing listeners with stories of antics involving his brothers and their cousins, the McLeans and the Fitzgeralds. Terry had a great love for the Eucharist and attended Mass daily (which was followed by a good golf game at the Par 3 with his friends). 

Terry was preceded in death by his parents, his brothers Don, Maurice, Bill, Dick and Pat West; and his sister, Rita Helgeson.

He is survived by his wife of 55 years, Donna; his sons Mark (Dana), Joe (Linda), Dan (Vicki) and Jerry (Janelle); his daughters, Sister Jill West, Marie Colasanti (Mike) and Julie Scott (Corey); his sister Gertrude (Joe) Vincent; and brother, Father Robert West; 14 grandchildren and one great-grandchild born in January.

Terry died peacefully on March 25, 2009, with his family at his side. He will be greatly missed by his family and friends, and the family would like to extend a thank-you to the helpful nurses and staff from the Billings Clinic Hospital. "

"14544","","fitzvalley","From Jean Shoenmaker:


This is the earliest record I\'ve seen for Nichols Bennett. 

Aquilla and Susannah didn\'t come to Upper Canada until 1810 and family lore is that Susannah had a \"babe in arms\" at the time.

After ten years of research into my family I came to the conclusion that though the story my aunt wrote in her book was true she had wrong names attached to the right situation. She said, to paraphrase, \"When Diademia was a little girl in Holland she was very ill. 

When she began to get better a Dutchman she had befriended gave her a root of his prize peony told her to keep it always as it was a symbol that God would take care of her no matter what happened . The family moved to Ireland where she married Peter Bennett an Irishman.\" My aunt went on to say, \"When the family wagon was packed the youngest daughter ran back to dig up a root of the peony to take to her new home. When they were floating the wagons with her household goods and her children across the Niagara River she was on horseback with her babe in her arms and the root of the peony in her saddlebag.\" 

Apparently when the German families were fleeing persecution in their homeland they came to America through Holland. 
The girl to whom the Dutchman gave the peony was apparently Margaretha Stroeher who married Peter Cober in America. When her youngest daughter, Susannah was leaving the family home for Upper Canada she ran back to dig up the peony to take with her. 

Both the story and the pink peony are in the famiily to this day. But a friend tells me Susannah wasn\'t on horseback with the baby in her arms as the horse would be too low in the water."

Deceased was confined to her bed but eight days and suffered much until about twenty minutes before she died in which time her prayer could be heard in a feeble voice in behalf of her children and aged husband. With uplifted hands she continued to pray until almost the last breath, when she quietly folded her hands on her breast and passed away.

While our family spells \"Ingebretsen\" with the \"sen\" ending, Uncle Buddy always thought it was not spelled correctly as most of the Norwegian heritage neighbors had the ending \"son\" at the end of their name.

"14577","","marrs","WM. MARRS KILLED Prosperous Farmer Meets Death This Morning Just as we are going to press, we hear of the sudden death of William Marrs who for some years has lived on a farm just northwest of Howard. We can gather no particulars at this time, but we learn that he was driving some young un-broke horses hitched to a manure spreader. No one witnessed the accident, but it is believed the horses ran away with the spreader and that Mr. Marrs was thrown out, and striking on his head, was instantly killed.

Mr. Marrs was about 60, and a good citizen and universally respected. He leaves a wife and several children, some grown and married.

THE HOWARD COURANT March 16, 1916 Obituary

William James Marrs was born in the state of Mississippi, March 2, 1857. When yet a child he with his parents moved to St. Louis, Mo., and about the year 1860 he came to this state, being a resident since that time.

He was united in marriage with Evelyn Whitmore, then of Sabetha, Kansas, in the year 1889. There were born to them seven children, two of whom died in infancy. The five remaining - Dr. Marrs, of Moline, Mrs. Oscar Haile, Willie, Harriet and Robert Marrs with their mother survive him.

Mr. Marrs became a member of the Christian church during the early years of his life and when he came to Howard he entered, readily into cooperation with the congregation of his place and continued therewith, being at the time of his death an Elder and a faithful teacher of a class of boys in the bible school. His sudden death was a shock to his brethren and friends and they will sadly miss his presence and fellowship.

The funeral services were very fittingly conducted from the place of his congregational devotions. Mr. Bemmis, minister of the Christian Church at Moline, assisted A. P. Sherman, the minister of the church here, and a multitude of friends and neighbors evidenced their regards for him and at the same time their sorrows that our brother should be called from us. May the \"Spirit\" speak its consolation: \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth; Yea, saith the spirit, they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.\" Rev. 14: 13"
"14578","","marrs","Mrs. Evelyn Marrs, born January 6, 1870, passed away at the hospital at Lamar, Missouri, where she had been a patient for two months, on June 23, 1950.

Shaw, pastor of the Howard Christian church. The music was furnished by Mrs. John Garison, Mrs. Willard Morss, Milo Munsinger and Jess Barger, with Mrs. J. E. Brinegar, accompanist. The pall bearers were Sherman Carter, Seth Fear, Carl Russell, Frank McLin, Dr. F. R. Reid and John McFall. Burial was in Grace Lawn cemetery, Howard.

Mrs. Marrs and her husband William Marrs, who passed away in 1916, moved to their farm, just northwest of Howard, from the North Pole community in 1901, where she made her home until recent years, since which time she had been spending most of her time with her children in Kansas and Missouri. She is survived by six children, Dr. E. A. Marrs, Sedan, Kansas; Mrs. O. L. Haile, Lamar, Missouri; Willie Marrs, Moline; Mrs. Glenn Topliff, Esbon, Kansas, and Bob Marrs of Howard, besides several grandchildren and other relatives and many friends.

Susan Ida Ingebretsen was born July 31, 1955, the daughter of Earl and Gladys (Chelin) Ingebretsen in Fargo, ND, and was raised in Morken Township, Clay County, MN. Susan was baptized, attended Sunday School, and was confirmed in the Christian faith at North Buffalo Lutheran Church, rural Moorhead. Susan graduated from Glyndon-Felton High School with the class of 1973 and furthered her education at MN State University at Moorhead. She worked in the accounting field; first for Deyle and Kelly in Fargo, then for George Kelly & Company and later for Fiebiger, Swanson, West & Company. Susan revered her employers, co-workers and clients.

On December 2, 1978, Susan was united in marriage to Carl Shaw at North Buffalo Lutheran Church. To this union, six children were born: Darren, Sarah, Brian, Barry, Nathan and Allen. For most of their years together, they made their home near Ulen.

Susan had been a member of Bethlehem Lutheran in Ulen where she served as a Sunday School Superintendent, a WELCA member and a member of the Board of Christian Education. Susan\'s favorite pastimes included crocheting and tending her beautiful flower beds as well as her vegetable gardens which she took great pride in the canning of the produce. In the summer, she would occasionally be found helping out on their farm raking hay driving an Allis Chalmers D-19 tractor that Grandpa Clifford called \"Susie\'s Tractor\", even though the rest of the farm was all International Harvester tractors. Susan delighted in spending time with her family and she especially loved the blessing of being a grandmother. If Susan\'s character of being devoted to God, family and friends was imitated by everyone, this world would be a far better place.

"14582","","fitzvalley","H. Van Ruschen is a practicing attorney of Marion, Turner county. He was born in Illinois on the 4th of April, 1877, a son of W. and Johanna (Addengast) Van Ruschen. The family came to South Dakota in 1879 and settled on a homestead near Chancellor. During the first year of their residence here a cyclone destroyed their cabin, then the grasshoppers and the drought came and no crops were produced. The family bore many hardships and privations incident to frontier life under such conditions, but in time their courage and determination triumphed and success came to them. The father is now living retired in Marion.

H. Van Ruschen was educated in the district schools and afterward held various clerical positions. At length he determined upon the practice of law as a life work and with that end in view began reading in the office and under the direction of the firm of Jones & Jones of Parker. In 1906 he took the bar examination and was admitted to practice and in December of the same year was admitted to practice in the United States courts. He is the pioneer lawyer of Marion and has resided there continuously since 1888. From the first he has been accorded a large and distinctively representative clientage and his ability has advanced him to a front rank among the able lawyers of his part of the state.

On the 16th of September, 1909, Mr. Van Ruschen was united in marriage to Miss Susan Vogt, her father being Jacob F. Vogt, a pioneer of this state. To this union has been born a daughter, Mildred.

In religious faith Mr. Van Ruschen is a Protestant and in politics hi independent, with leanings toward the progressive party. Fraternally he is an Elk, an Odd Fellow, a Woodman, a Yeoman and a Loyal American, and he is also connected with the Rebekah degree of Odd Fellowship. He has been identified with the local newspaper of Marion and he has served as president of the Commercial Club and of the local improvement club. He is treasurer of the Cemetery Association. On several occasions he has been called to public office, as he served as city attorney from 1908 to 1912, and has also been justice of the peace and school clerk, while in 1909 he was elected to represent his district in the state legislature. He made a creditable, record and received the indorsement of his fellow townsmen but declined a reelection. In 1915 he was again appointed city attorney. He has ever worked for the advancement and upbuilding of the community in which he makes his home and has ever indorsed those plans and movements which are a matter of civic virtue and civic pride. His worth is widely acknowledged by his fellow townsmen, who find in him a man worthy of public trust and one whose devotion to the general good stands above question.
