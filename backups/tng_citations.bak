Vernon St., is a massive but plain brick house that is suggestive of the size of the fortunes made here in the grain and mercantile business of the early 19th century. It was built by John Cummins (1777-1833), who at 21 became a partner in the leading store, soon bought out the owner, and also went into the grain trade. Within 20 years he had become the leading grain merchant in Delaware and had made Smyrna second only to Wilmington as a grain port. From Delaware, and a large part of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, came many wagonloads of grain to be carried in his vessels to Wilmington, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston; returning, his schooners brought manufactured goods and supplies, which were placed in his warehouses, whence his wagons set out for towns and crossroads stores of two States.

A few feet from the south end of the house is a small square brick building covered with gray flaking paint; this was the office of the merchant, and is a survivor of days when nearly every prosperous merchant, lawyer, and doctor in the State had his sanctum in a separate little building near his home, where many pipe-smoking or tobacco-chewing afternoons were spent with congenial callers.","","",""

He was a son of Anthony Morris, mariner, or Welsh origin, who at the date of birth of his son Anthony was residing in Old Gravel Lane, Stepney, but later removed to Barbados, and was lost at sea when on his return voyage in 1655 or 1656. He was born about the year 1630, and probably was a son of another Anthony Morris, of Reading, Berkshire, born about 1600. He married Elizabeth Senior, who soon after her husband\'s death made a voyage to Barbados, in connection with the settlement of his estate, and died there in 1660. Anthony Morris spent his boyhood days in the city of London, and, prior to arriving at his majority, united himself with the Society of Friends, becoming a member of Savoy Meeting, in the Strand, which was connected with the Westminster Monthly Meeting. On 12mo. (February) 2, 1675-6, he declared intentions of marriage with Mary Jones belonging to the same Meeting and they were married 1mo. (March) 30, 1676. They continued to reside in London until near the close of the year 1682, and four children were born to them there, Susanna, Mary, and two who were named for the father, all of whom died there except the last.They embarked for the Delaware river in which they arrived in the latter part of February, 1682-3, and took up their home in Burlington, New Jersey. In the latter part of 1685, or early in 1686, he removed to Philadelphia and began his successful career as a merchant. Three more children were born by his first wife to him in America, John in Burlington, 2mo. 17, 1685, and Samuel and James in Philadelphia. His first wife died in Philadelphia, 8mo.

He was a son of Anthony Morris, mariner, or Welsh origin, who at the date of birth of his son Anthony was residing in Old Gravel Lane, Stepney, but later removed to Barbados, and was lost at sea when on his return voyage in 1655 or 1656.

He married Elizabeth Senior, who soon after her husband\'s death made a voyage to Barbados, in connection with the settlement of his estate, and died there in 1660.  Anthony Morris spent his boyhood days in the city of London, and, prior to arriving at his majority, united himself with the Society of Friends, becoming a member of Savoy Meeting, in the Strand, which was connected with the Westminster Monthly Meeting.  On 12mo. (February) 2, 1675-6, he declared intentions of marriage with Mary Jones belonging to the same Meeting and they were married 1mo. (March) 30, 1676.  They continued to reside in London until near the close of the year 1682, and four children were born to them there, Susanna, Mary, and two who were named for the father, all of whom died there except the last.They embarked for the Delaware river in which they arrived in the latter part of February, 1682-3, and took up their home in Burlington, New Jersey.  In the latter part of 1685, or early in 1686, he removed to Philadelphia and began his successful career as a merchant.

Hi Thomas, well after some extensive looking throught the records i am glad to report that i found one more of the siblings. I don\'t trust there index or the ones who recorded information because to many mistakes were made so i did a page by page search. I found Jospeh born 13 Aug 1862 and bapt. 14 aug 1862 Wit: Antoine chartier and Dorthee Bertrand.  My french is not so good, but  one of the lines in his bapt. says
maries peres? un ministre protestant leguel infant  born 13 of the month........Hope this may help a bit more. Have a good day.   Jim

...Joseph was not recorded under the name vallee in the index, but was recorded as Dolbec. They must have misread it when they did the index"

My mother (Lorraine DeWaele) said that Cesaire was so handsome that when he walked down the street in Bay City, the women pull back their lace curtains to get a better look (1890s). I have only one photo of him but you will be able to see how debonair he looks. His sister was a nun in Canada and I have a letter written in French - her language - written in the early 1900\'s. That line of the family only spoke French which is what my grandmother spoke growing up and she taught it to her children.

Evidently Cesaire\'s wife Josephine wasn\'t well after having a number of children, so she went back to be nursed by her mother where she died from her ailment. Cesaire was left to raise the children. He found raising the children too dificult so farmed out the ones who were very young. George was adopted by the Browns. 

John Arthur Thorne writes:

Found em!! The Cesaire/ Caesar Archambeault/Archambault (would the correct spelling please stand up) family is listed in the 1880 Michigan census for Bay County/ Augres Township. Augres was part of Bay County until 1884; at which time the current Arenac County was formed. Fortunately, I have access to a data base at my resource center that gives complete history (from inception) for every city/ village/ township. Anyway, hereeeeeesss the Archambeaults:

Name Age Relationship Occupation Birthplace Parent\'s B-place
Cesaire 46 Hd of Hsehld Blacksmith Canada Canada
Josephine 35 Wife Keeping House \" \" 
Minnie 14 Daughter Attending School \" \"
Delphine 10 \" \" \" \"
Eloise (Alice) 4 \" Michigan \"
Helen 1 \" \" \"


Eloise must be great aunt Alice, but who\'s Minnie? Note that sometime between the birth of Delphine (1870) and Eloise (1876), they moved from Canada to Michigan. That narrows my future Canada location search for their place of origin (and parents) somewhat. Shouldn\'t have much trouble finding the three daughter\'s Canadian birth registrations; plus Cesaire/Josephine\'s marriage certificate (circa 1865) now that the approximate timeframes are known. Have found numerous Archambault\'s in French Canada, all spelled without the e (i.e.not beault). Also several Cesaires, spelled as shown here. Fun huh?","","",""

Sandra Thorne Borgon (1942) writes:
Helen (1879-1949) talked very little about her family. Helen was set to marry a man who worked in the lumbermill around 1900. He fell into a tree grinder and was killed. It took her many years to get over it and she was 26 when she married my grandfather which was really old back then to get married - most women did by the time they were 18 or so. Grandmother had wanted to be a doctor but wasn\'t allowed in any medical colleges because she was a woman, So she became a nurse. Although nursing started some years earlier, she really was one of the first who professionally did this (nursing actually began in the 1870\'s in American but nurses didn\'t come together as a profession until the late 1890\'s so it was really very new when she did it). She ususally worked as a private nurse for wealthy families, living with them to take care of an ill relative. Because of her love of medicine, my mother\'s brother Paul became a doctor. 

Helen had a weak heart, and her first child Arthur inherited this and died a few days after birth. Son Paul died at 54 of a sudden heart attack. She died from heart failure at 69. 

Helen was very quiet, sweet, and gentle. Spoke fluent French as a child. 

John Arthur Thorne (1938) writes:
Many relatives of Helen Archambault were the very earliest settlers in the Detroit region. Most lived on the southern shore of the Detroit environs which was called Assumption Sandwich, as well as Coast of the Potowatomies. It is now known as Essex County, Ontario, Canada. 

On May 24, 1938, Arthur (61), his wife Helen (59), sister Emily (66), and daughter Alice (27) visited the family in Europe. They travelled 750 miles from Bay City, MI to Montreal, Canada in their own car. On May 27 at 10am they took a boat to Glasgow, Scotland with their car on the boat. Here they visited Emily\'s husband\'s roots (who passed away in December 1933). They stayed one day in Scotland, drove the car to London, then to Dover then over the North Sea to Ostende (Belgium). They visited several countries and saw Arthur\'s brother Edgar for the first time in 49 years, as well as his wife Marie and their children (including Romanie). ","","",""

Did find a short Bay City Times article on Boyd Badour\'s death. It\'s not dated, but I recall the timeframe as 1926. Titled \"Wounds Fatal To Detroit Officer. Boyd Badour, Formerly of this City, Died Sunday Morning.\"

\"Boyd Badour, a Detroit patrolman and resident of Bay City until four years ago when he married Miss Lilian Morris, of this City, died Sunday morning at receiving hospital from bullet wounds suffered in a battle with negroes in a gambling house at 2036 St. Aubin, the evening of March 27.\"
\"Mr. Badour was shot with his own gun after it had been knocked from his hand. He had entered the place in search of two men who were wanted for the murder of Leroy Coble, conductor on a Detroit City street car. He found a dozen or more negroes gambling and was attacked when he attempted to put them under arrest.\"
\"During the battle that followed, one of the negroes recovered the weapon and fired six shots at the officer. Three of the bullets struck him, one lodging in the abdomen, another in the right leg, and a third in the right hand.\"

\" Surviving are his wife, two children, June and Junior, his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Abraham Badour, of Omer, four sisters and one brother. Funeral arrangements will probably be held Thursday from the residence, 3792 Bewick Avenue, Detroit. Mrs. Badour is the sister of Mrs. George Leske, 2103 Van Buren street","","",""

Sandra Kay has a picture of infant Arthur in his baptismal gown, being held by Arthur Sr. The gown was made from Grandma\'s (Helen) wedding dress; and all the DeWaele children were baptized in it. The gown was \"resurrected\" in 1991 for Kylee Thorne\'s baptism; and (I believe) it was worn by Molly O\'Donnell in 2001. That\'s a span of 95 years. Great tradition!

He married at Kaskaskia on Jan. 21, 1751   to Marie Magdeleine Turpin, daughter of Joseph Turpin & wife, Hypolite Chauvin de la Freniere.

Pierre Tessier lived at New Chartres, Illinois post as late as 1765, where he was a \"voyageur\" (travelling merchant)  but later removed to Natchitoches, Louisiana, according to statement given by son Pierre Tessier, to Commandant @ Nacogdoches, 1810, stating he had visited them in Louisiana \"about 2 and 1/2 months, about the year 1806-7.

 I do not know when/where Pierre Tessier died, but it was prior to 178-82, as his widow Marie Magdeleine Turpin married her second husband,  Joseph Auger, about that time, they having at least one child, a son Joseph Auger (II) who married in Opelousas Post, La, on Feb 8, 1803 to Celeste De la Fosse.  The parents of the groom in this marriage record are given as Joseph Auger & Madeleine Turpin. (Ref=Fr. Hebert\'s records, Vol I, P 16)

Joseph Auger, s/o Joseph Auger & Magdalen Turpin, had a daughter named Brigitte. Brigitte\'s godparents were Joseph LaMirande & Rosalie Benoit. Reference: Opel Church v 1-B p 358 Brigitte was baptized 4 Aug 1805 at the age of 3 months.

Several of their Tessier children migrated to area of Natchitoches, Louisiana  where their names can be found in the Catholic Church records, and were living in Bayou Pierre area, Nacogdoches District,  in the late 1700\'s and the early 1800\'s.","","",""

\"I will tell you all I remember about my ancestors. My great, grandfather, your great, great grandfather was James Raymond a privy counselor of the State of Deleware and also a member of the Continental Congress. It was Clara Denney who tried to form a James Raymond Chapter of the DAR\'s of Delaware and wrote me asking me to become regent of it and I think she also asked your mother but I did not care to enter into it.

Then my great great grandfather, your great great great grandfather, a Hardscastle served in the Revolutionary War and they (his descendents) were so proud of it they sold the sword he used at his death for one dollar and Harry, my husband bought it and had it until his death, then I gave it to this Harry and that same old Col Beyer disinherited his grandson, because he was an old secessionist if he did live in PA.

One of Edith Firm(?) asked her if she had any French blood in her and she said, \"I don\'t know but I will ask my Aunt\". He said several traits of character and features indicated, and he had then made a study of things. Well I remember of a Raymond in New York some years ago, who wrote to Jake and me several times, who said he had found out that all Raymonds in this country were descendents of Count Raymond of Toulouse, a French Crusader who was in search of the holy grail. Now! Sarah, \"What color do you think our blood must be after all that? Surely something better than blue.","","",""

Right Reverend George D. Cummins, the founder and senior Bishop of the Reformed Episcopal Church, died at his residence at Lutherville, Baltimore county, at half-past two-o\'clock yesterday afternoon.  His death was sudden and quite unexpected by the large number of the Bishop\'s friends, many of whom but a few days before had seen him in the vigor of life and health, who entertained the hope that his brilliant faculties would remain at their height for many years.  On Sunday the 17th of this month he delivered his last sermon at Bethany Independent Methodist Church, preaching both morning and evening.  A sketch of his morning sermon appeared in The American on the following day.  This was his last appearance in any church.  On Sunday night he went home to Lutherville, and for the next few days suffered from a severe cold.  He paid but little attention to this ailment, which continued to grow worse day by day.  On Thursday he began to suffer from inflammation of the bowels, and yesterday morning his friends noticing that he was failing, Mr. E H Cummins, his son, was dispatched for Drs. Christopher Johnston and Williams, Dr. Peebles having previously attended him.  Dr. Johnston hurried to Calvert Station to take the train for Lutherville, but was met at the gate by a dispatch announcing the death of the patient.  The information was communicated to Mr. Cummins, who would not at first believe its truth until he was shown the telegram, which was sent from Towsontown, and signed \"E. H. Cummins,\" whose name had been used by the parties sending the message.  He forthwith took the car and proceeded home, and discovered that the information was only too true.  Baltimore American, June 27.","","",""

Hill, who has resided within the borders of Cherokee county for three decades, was in former years successfully identified with agricultural and industrial interests as a farmer and blacksmith but is now discharging the duties devolving upon him in the capacity of deputy sheriff, to which position he was appointed in July, 1911. His birth occurred in Argyleshire, Scotland, on the 4th of February, 1847, his parents being Donald and Agnes (Mathewson) Hill, likewise natives of that country. The father, a blacksmith by trade, emigrated to the United States and located near Kankakee, Illinois, where he passed away in 1858, two months after his arrival in the new world. His widow subsequently took up her abode in the Scotch settlement near Rockford, Illinois, where she spent the remainder of her life. Mr. and Mrs. Donald Hill were devoted and consistent members of the Presbyterian church. Their children were as follows: Mary, who is the widow of Hugh McMichael and resides in Winnebago, Illinois; John M. of this review; Margaret, who is the widow of James Porter and lives in Rockford, Illinois; Donald, formerly a resident of Storm Lake, Iowa, who passed away in August, 1913; Agnes, who is the widow of Robert Halley, and makes her home in Beloit, Wisconsin; Archibald, of Rockford, Illinois; Angus, who is deceased; and Barbara, the wife of James Patterson, of Winnebago, Illinois.

   John M. Hill began his education in the schools of Kilkenzie, Scotland, and was eleven years of age when he accompanied his parents on their emigration to the United States, the family home being established in Illinois. His first farm comprised eighty acres near Rockford and claimed his attention until 1883, when he disposed of the property and came to Cherokee county, Iowa, purchasing a tract of land in Cherokee township. Subsequently he removed to Cedar township and there carried on general agricultural pursuits for five years, on the expiration of which period he took up his abode in Cherokee and embarked in business as a blacksmith, remaining a member of the firm of Lint Brothers & Hill for three years. In 1898 he was elected sheriff, holding that position for two terms or until 1902. In that year he again turned his attention to blacksmithing and successfully followed that trade until July 11, 1911, which he was appointed to the position of deputy sheriff, the duties of which office he has able discharged to the present time, making an enviable and creditable record in that connection.

   On the 8th of January, 1877, Mr. Hill was united in marriage to Miss Jennie Geddis, a daughter of Alexander and Jennie (Cormack) Geddis, of Avon, New York. Their children are as follows: Madge, Jean, Mary and Winifred; John M., a resident of Fort Doge, Iowa; and Archibald, who makes his home in Woodstock, Illinois.

   In his political views Mr. Hill is a stanch democrat, believing firmly in the principles of that party. His religious faith is that of the Presbyterian church, while fraternally he is identified with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. A man of genuine personal worth and high standards of integrity, he commands the sincere regard and esteem of all who come in contact with him and in the course of his many years\' residence in Cherokee county has proved his loyalty as a public official, his reliability in business and his fidelity to all the ties and obligations of life.","","",""

In 1851 they sailed with their seven children to America. The trip from Frane to New Orleans took six weeks by sailboat. Legend indicates that the journey was often rough and some days the ship was driven back by high winds farther than they had accomplished the day before. From the port of New Orleans they traveled up the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers to LaSalle, IL - then to DuPage County where they lived in the vicinity of Naperville, IL.

In approximately 1854, walking and herding their livestock.....George, Anastasia and their children brought their personal possessions and household goods in a covered wagon to Henry County. They settled in either Loraine or Yorktown Township.

George died at the age of 63 and anastasia at the age of 79. They had nine children, however many records are incomplete and only seven could be indentified; George, Michael, Barnhart, Theresa, Helen, Julienne and a young daughter who drowned at the lake northeast of Hooppole, IL.

No information is availabe (as of 1983) to indicate where George, Anastasia, and the young daughter are buried.

The following is the repsonse received from Wittisheim, France concerning our requests for the Egert family\'s emigration records:

\"We acknowledge your request for the list of emigrants to America but are unable to respond. We are sure that a list existed at one time, however, due to the bombardment during WWII many of the documents were burned and destroyed. I believe that these are among the ones have been lost. This is from the records of Wittisheim, France.\"

Vernon St., is a massive but plain brick house that is suggestive of the size of the fortunes made here in the grain and mercantile business of the early 19th century. It was built by John Cummins (1777-1833), who at 21 became a partner in the leading store, soon bought out the owner, and also went into the grain trade. Within 20 years he had become the leading grain merchant in Delaware and had made Smyrna second only to Wilmington as a grain port. From Delaware, and a large part of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, came many wagonloads of grain to be carried in his vessels to Wilmington, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston; returning, his schooners brought manufactured goods and supplies, which were placed in his warehouses, whence his wagons set out for towns and crossroads stores of two States.
 
A few feet from the south end of the house is a small square brick building covered with gray flaking paint; this was the office of the merchant, and is a survivor of days when nearly every prosperous merchant, lawyer, and doctor in the State had his sanctum in a separate little building near his home, where many pipe-smoking or tobacco-chewing afternoons were spent with congenial callers.QUAY ","","",""

Salem Monthly Meeting (N.J.) 1676; 2. Burlington Monthly Meeting (N.J.) 1678; 3. Philadelphia Monthly Meeting (PA.) 1682; 4. Falls Monthly Meeting (PA) 1683. PAGE 9-10 Have you ever dates like this? - \"13 January 1709/10\", This is not a date which attempts to reveal a Dec-Jan date. It appears because the \"Old Style\" calendar was superseded in 1752 by the Gregorian (New Style) calendar. Actually it was 1752 when an Act of Parliament passed \"the day following 2 September 1752\" was called \"14 September\". Concurrently, the beginning of the legal year was changed from 25 March to the 1st of January. As early as 1700, other European counties adopted the Gregorian calender, with the year beginning January 1st. 

Thus, it became the custom in England and its colonies to give two dates for the period intervening between 1 January and 25 March, as 13 January 1709/10. The day following 24 March 1709/10 was 25 March 1710. ","","","The following chart shows the months: 1mo. = Mar, 2mo. = Apr, 3mo.= May, 4mo. = Jun, 5 mo. = Jul, 6mo. = August, 7mo. = Sep, 8mo = Oct, 9mo = Nov, 10mo. = Dec, 11mo. = Jan, 12mo = Feb.

The Friends added to the confusion by designating months by numbers instead of by names. January was the 11th month, February the 12th month.

Edward J. Hefele, electronics expert and inventor, died Tuesday in his home at 42-07 Elbertston Street, Elmhurst, Queens.  He was 55 years old.

Mr. Hefele started his electronics career in boyhood when he was an amateur radio operator communicating with foreign lands on home-built equipment.  In 1936, he invented the first cathode ray direction finder, which enables navigators to determine visually deviation from course by means of radio.

He also invented the streamlined antenna for planes and a blind landing system.  His father was the late George Hefele, who for many years was the city\'s chief authority on bridges.

Mr. Hefele was a graduate of Fordham and Columbia Universities.

He is survived by his widow, Essie; three daughters, Carol, Mary and Irene; a sister, Miss Mary E. Hefele, and a brother, George Hefele Jr.","","",""

BERRY, at present an assistant corporation counsel, and a lifelong resident of the Borough, since becoming of age has devoted his energies to public service, a field in which he attained distinction, and has taken a prominent part in every phrase of community development.  Born July 31, 1868, on Abringdon Square in the old Ninth Ward of Manhattan, he is a son of Richard A. and Bridget (Shea) Berry.  His mother, a native of Fordham, shortly after the birth of her son, returned to The Bronx, where the boy grew up.

Mr. Berry attended old Public School No. 65, in Fordham, from which he graduated in 1883, after which he entered Fordham College, in the academic department, graduating with the degrees of Bachelor and Master of Arts.  His college career finished, Mr. Berry accepted the position on manager of the Fordham branch of the Church E. Gates and Company lumber company, and remained in that capacity for five years.  By this time he knew something of business and the world in general, as well as his own inclinations.  He determined, in the light of this knowledge, to take up the study of law, entering the New York Law School, from which he was graduated in 1897, with the degree of Bachelor of Laws.  The same year he was admitted to the bar.  His first practice was as an associate in the office of William B. Ellison, a prominent attorney, subsequently corporation counsel of New York City, from whom the young lawyer acquired considerable legal knowledge and experience.  Mr. Berry then entered the office of Henry D. Purroy, attorney-at-law, becoming his partner in the law firm which continued until Mr. Berry was drafted by the Independent forces in The Bronx to run for coroner.  Successful, he held this office from 1902 to 1906.  He then formed a partnership with Henry K. Davis, with whom he had offices at No. 320 Broadway, New York, and No. 2649 Webster Avenue, The Bronx, their practice prospering until 1910.  In 1906, Mr. Berry was appointed by Mayer George B. McClellan, commissioner of parks for the Borough.  He joined the National Guard of the State and become commanding officer of the Battalion of Field Artillery stationed in the Borough.  As his private practice grew, so did his activities in civic matters.  He was one of the little band that began the agitation for the erection of the territory north of the Harlem River into a new county, -- a movement which grew despite great opposition upon the part of both great political parties, and, which resulted, some eleven years later in the creation of the county of Bronx.  Because of his popularity he was drafted as the political leader of the old thirty-fifth District, and on the reapportionment of the State of the new Eighth District.  He also held the office of State transfer tax appraiser.  Rose Hill Park, the widening of the Pelham Parkway, the development of De Voe Park, the extension of the public golf links and the creation of the Fordham Plaza are monuments of the efforts and labor of Mr. Berry and those he interested in these projects.  In 1918 he was appointed an assistant corporation counsel of New York City by Corporation Counsel Burr.  He is now in charge of the Bureau of Penalties.

Mr. Berry was one of the organizers of the Brownson Literary Union, which afterwards became the Brownson Catholic Club, and served it as president for five years.  He was also one of the organizers of The Bronx Bar Association.  He belongs to a number of social and political clubs, and religious and fraternal organizations.

On November 10, 1897, Mr. Berry married Eva Harriett Baack, daughter of Edward and Margaret Baack.  Mr. and Mrs. Berry live on Valentine Avenue in The Bronx.

[Stated in sev\'l pub\'s, one copying from ano with no actual source cited in any.

They were granted two acres jointly at that time on the North side of the town. Tog\'r they sold prop\'y w/John SHAW to Edward DOTEY in 1637. B#11 mentions a Joshua PRATT who was in Medfield in 1649. B#64 names w. Bathsheba FAY of Marlboro with no evidence cited. 

B#748 states wife Bathsheba arrived after 22 May 1627 and was listed as \"Joshua Pratt\'s wife.\" The births of Joshua and Bathsheba\'s chn were not recorded in Plym.; perh. b. Eng. bef. 1627. Dtr Hannah is id\'d in a deed w/ husb. William SPOONER acc\'g to B#859. B#158 and other ref\'s have variously attrib. to Joshua the chn of his son Benajah, as well as unrelated PRATTs in far removed areas of Mass. Bay Colony with no evidence offered (as there could be none) or rationale exercised. 

By scrutinizing Shurtleff\'s Plymouth Colony Records JPL has determined that Joshua and Bathsheba had at least one son, Benajah:  On 2 Nov 1640 \"these several persons are granted meddowing in the South Meddows toward Aggawam, Colebrook Meddowes: ... to Josuah [sic] PRATT, five acres.\"  No deed of sale or gift from Joshua PRATT re this parcel is recorded. When Benajah (below) died in 1682, an inv\'y of his estate incl. \"five acres of meddow att the South Meddows\" [Plym. Prob. Vol. IV(2) p.12]. When Benajah\'s lands were div\'d in June that yr, his eldest son Joshua rec\'d as part of his share \"one acre of meddow att the South Meddow\" and the two youngest sons rec\'d tog\'r \"four acres of meddow at the South Meddowes\" as part of their share. [Vol IV(2) p.14]  This definitive description and precise division of a parcel of land owned by Joshua PRATT proves irrefutably that he was the fa of Benajah below. [Note:  In Feb 1996 the NSDFPA accepted JPL\'s membership application based upon this evidence.]  

By process of elimination, Joshua was very prob. fa of Jonathan also. The only other PRATT of Joshua\'s generation in the area was Phineas whose chn are all documented in various est. records. Jonathan rem. to Bristol Co. where a search of deeds might produce proof of his relationship to Joshua; but Shurtleff lists no early deeds for him in Plym. Co. Widow Bathsheba was granted admin. of Joshua\'s est., 6 Oct 1656. She m. 29 Aug 1667, Plymouth, John DOGGETT/ DAGGETT of Martha\'s Vineyard. Note:  JPL has not seen any proof of her maiden name and would be interested if such exists. An article in B#1247 implies that she may have been related to John DUNHAM who named a son Benajah and whose dtr Persis 15 yrs later mar. Joshua PRATT\'s son Benajah below. It is prob. that Hannah below was a dtr.

"11505","fitzvalley","I8779218626","","S8072387439","0","","","0000-00-00","Henry Nawman, deceased, was born in German township during the early period of Clark county’s development and through more than sixty years [sic] was known as a leading and representative citizen of his community. His natal day was July 16, 1817, his birth occurring on the farm which is still occupied by his widow. His parents were Thomas and Catherine (Baker) Nawman, who were pioneer settlers of German township and aided in laying broad and deep the foundation for the present prosperity and progress of this portion of Ohio. Henry Nawman acquired a good common school education, pursuing his studies through the winter months when his services were not needed on the home farm. He lived in the usual manner of farmer lads of that period, taking his place as a hand in the fields at an early age, and thus he gained a broad and practical experience of farm work.

On the 29th of March, 1855, Mr. Nawman married Miss Ingebee Jane Rhonemus, of Clark county, who was born in Clinton county, Ohio, August 17, 1834, a daughter of William and Matilda (Clark) Rhonemus. Her father was born and reared in Clinton county, while her mother’s birth oicurred [sic] in Virginia, where she remained until she attained to womanhood. Both were well educated people and successfully engaged in teaching in early life. After their marriage the father turned his attention to farming, while Mrs. Rhonemus continued her work as a teacher for a number of years. Removing to Indiana Mr. Rhonemus purchased land there, but on account of poor health he could not till his fields and therefore returned to Clinton county, Ohio, whence he afterward came to Clark county. Mrs. Nawman had resided in this county about two years prior to her marriage. She was taken as a bride to the home farm upon which she now resides, Mr. Nawman having inherited about seventy acres of land here. His parents made their home with the young couple until called to their final rest. As the years passed, children to the number of twelve were added to the family. Clara is now the wife of John Kunkle, of Clark county, and they have eight children. Samuel G. is married and has one child. Thomas wedded Alice Hinkle, by whom he had four children, and for his second wife he chose Mrs. Mary Yerkle, nee Baker. Lousia died at the age of fourteen years and six months. William is living in the west. Mary died at the age of fifteen years. Webster married Mrs. Elizabeth Hinkle, in Donovan, and they have three children. Catherine became the wife of Charles Wey and has one child. Matilda married Albert Greene and with their two children they reside in Clark county. Amanda is the wife of Jesse Belt, of Springfield, and has two children. Andrew married Leah Harris and they have four children. Henry wedded Emma Collison and they have two children.

In his political views Mr. Nawman was a Democrat in early life, but subsequently became a Republican and was fearless in defense of his honest convictions. He was a man of medium height, heavy build, with light hair and blue eyes. Being of a rather reserved nature he made friends slowly, but he never lost one, and his family and friends knew him as a pleasant, genial gentleman, of generous disposition. He was always willing to aid in good and worthy causes and the sterling traits of his manhood were such as are well worthy of emulation. He carried on farm work until his death, which occurred June 24, 1870. When he died there were twelve children n the family, the eldest being little more than fourteen years of age, while the youngest was only three weeks old. The mother, with brave and resolute spirit, kept them all together until they were grown, giving to each a fair common school education. It was almost a herculean task and her neighbors predicted that she could not do it, but by great perseverance and untiring labor she accomplished it and she certainly deserves the gratitude and love of her children for what she did for them. She is a most estimable lady and has furnished to the world a worthy example of devoted and self-sacrificing motherhood.

He is a native of German Township, born Feb. 3, 1819; he is a son of Thomas and Catharine (Baker) Naw-man, natives of Virginia. The grandfather, Thomas Nawman, is supposed to have been born in Massachusetts. He was one of those resolute men who resisted the En-glish rule and imposition of heavy duties, and assisted in throwing overboard the cargo of tea in Boston harbor, and which, followed by other acts and events, resulted in the war of the Revolution. Thomas Nawman, the father, emigrated to Ohio in 1806, com-ing through the entire journey on horseback, and located in German Township. Soon after his arrival, he was afflicted with a white-swelling, during which time he lived with one of the early settlers by the name of Friarmood, with whom he stayed two years; thence returned to Virginia, and, in 1809, came back to Ohio, the entire family of his father coming with him, and here the grandfather and the father lived and died, being truly pioneers of the county, enduring the many dangers and hardships of that early day, struggling with the wilderness, the wild beasts, the Indians, and the difficulties of the war of 1812. But Mr. Nawman, the father, lived to see these difficulties over-come, and fine farms take the place of the wilderness, and the hand of civilization to bring forth towns and cities, and the comforts and conveniences of one of the finest countries in the world. He died in January, 1863, aged 82 years. His wife died in April, 1864, aged 79 years. They were parents of seven children, three now living - Samuel, Magdalene and Amanda.

Married to Eva Nawman, June 23, 1806; died December 31, 1847 and was buried in Green Mount Cemetery.  His wife was born July 11, 1787 and died September, 1869.

Mr. Kizer came to Clark County in the 1809 and settled on Section 7, Town 4, Range 10, M R S, in what is now German Township (it was then called Boston), and took an active part in the public affairs of that day.  He was chosen Justice of the Peace in 1811; was \"out\" in the war of 1812, and upon the establishment of this county in 1818, was appointed its first Recorder, to which office he was several times re-elected.

A man of undaunted courage and great strength of character, combined with a powerful frame and a good constitution, he was a superior representative of that old class of Virginia pioneers which contributed so much to the settlement of the West, and the establishment of American independence.  He was what was called a good scholar in those early days, and taught school in Virginia before he became a pioneer.  In 1820-21, he conducted a school in Springfield, which employment helped to piece out the scanty income of the Recorder\'s office.

The first of the above schools was held in a building which stood on the site of the present residence of Edward P. Torbert.  The second was in the front or \"office part\" of what was \"Jake Lingle\'s pottery,\" on the northeast corner of Spring and North streets.

Mr. Kizer brought a small library of books with him, and being inclined to scholarly habits, his house was the headquarters of the literary element of its neighborhood.  The children of this pioneer were Phoebe, born May 20, 1807; Rebeca, born May 29, 1809; Lydia, born April 15, 1811; Thomas, born December 18, 1812; Susannah, born August 17, 1815; Eli, born January 25, 1823.","690","",""

Lancy was Principal.  He then learned the trade of a millwright, during the practice of which he decided to become a surveyor, and, in 1836, made his debut as such by running out 50 acres of land for John and Emanuel Tirkle; he afterward become connected with the surveys of the United States public lands at various places.

During the old militia period, he was chosen to fill various offices and attained the rank of Lieutenant Colonel; his long and constant intercourse with the people has given him a large fund of anecdotes and occurrences, which fund is disbursed freely when the time is opportune.  In 1844, he was married to Miss Mary A.

William de Hertburn was undoubtedly an ancestor of the Washington family. To support his argument Mr G. S H. L. Washington points out that William de Hertburn, who is also referred to as William de Wessington or Washington (he will henceforth be called William (I) de Washington), also owned the adjacent manor of Offerton, whose previous lord had been a Sir Patric. Mr Washington identifies Sir Patric with Patric of Dunbar, i.e., Gospatric (III), 2nd Earl of Dunbar. Again, William de Washington\'s grandson Sir Walter de Washington bore as his coat of arms not the celebrated bars and molets which George Washington 1st President of the USA employed as a bookplate, but the Dunbar lion \'differenced\' (i.e., with a slight modification to signify such circumstances as its being used by a younger branch of the family, as may have been the case here).","","",""

His parents, Andrew and Mary (Gideon) Bennett were born respectively in Marion County, Indiana, and in Ohio.  The father\'s birth occurred October 22, 1835, and his death in Madison County, Iowa on the 14th of December, 1905, but the mother, who was born Apr 24, 1841, is still living here.  The paternal grandfather, Jacob Bennett, was born in Fayette County, Pennsylvania in 1800 and in 1851 removed to this county from Indiana, where he had previously settled, making the trip with ox teams and wagons.  He was well-to-do and brought five thousand dollars of gold with him.  Generosity was one of his salient characteristics and at times when his neighbors had no crops nor money with which to buy, he gave them of his store, although he might have sold his grain elsewhere at a dollar a bushel.  He became an extensive landowner, holding title to over one thousand acres.  He was public-spirited and took an active part int he betterment of conditions in his locality.  He gave the ground for the first school building in Madison township and served as supervisor.  His life was devoted to agricultural pursuits and made further improvments on his place from time to time.  His first residence was a log cabin in which he lived in true pioneer fashion.  His son Andrew drove a team on the journey to Iowa and in the early days when deer and elk were plentiful he caught several young elk and broke them to drive.  Many times he drove them to Winterset but finally traded them to his brother in Missouri for mules.  Like his father, he had no political aspirations but was very active and energetic and did much to assist his poor neighbors.  The big snow storm of 1855 caused the family considerable hardship and there was the usual discomforts of living in an unsettled region.  There were eighteen children in the family, of whom he was the fifth in order of birth.

Our subject\'s maternal grandparents were Henry and Nancy Gideon, who came to Iowa in October, 1854.  The grandfather was born September 28, 1798, and the grandmother September 28, 1806.  They had a family of eleven children, nine sons and two daughters, all who was born in Ohio, namely:  Jacob; Alfred; Sara Ann, who died August 3, 1894; Joseph; James, who died August 31, 1903; Peter; Valentine; Sandford, who died December 28, 1902; David, who died October 3, 1861; Mary E and Oliver.  The father of these children died on the 22 November, 1882 and the mother passed away July 5, 1869.  Their son Oliver was married October 16, 1867 to Mary E Kerrick, by whom he had five children, four sons and one daughter.  They made their home on the banks of North River and during the flood of July 4, 1876, their home was washed away and the wife and three children were drowned.  Oliver, with the two remaining children, managed to hold on to a little green sapling all night before he was rescued by a neighbor, William Terry.  A search was then made for the other members of the family, and the wife and two children were found about a mile down stream, but the body of the baby was not found until the next day.  They were all laid to rest in what is known as the Bennett graveyard.

Alfred Leman Bennett attended school in the first schoolhouse built in Douglas township and took advantage of the educational opportunities of that early day.  When 22 years of age he began farming in Douglas township and with the exception of 1892 has continue to reside there.  He owns 100 acres of excellent land and in addition to raising the usual crops is a stockman.  He keeps the farm work well in hand, sees that all necessary repairs and buildings are made and that the fields are in a high state of cultivation.  As he is efficient and prevents as far as possible all waste of time and energy, he has time after his farm work is done to devote to outside affairs.  He possesses the family trait of dislike for publicity, but is always in the front rank when there is anything to be done for the good of the community.  He has no political aspirations, but his neighbors, who recognize his ability, have elected him to a number of township offices.

In 1890 Mr. Bennett was married to Miss Ola Negus, a native of Jefferson, Greene County, Iowa, born December 28, 1871, a daughter of Obed Warren and Hannah (Hungerford) Negus.  Her father was born in Fabius, New York, May 31, 1826, a son of Thaddeus Negus and a descendant of revolutionary stock, his ancestors having fought for the independence of the colonies.  He passed away at Atlantic, Iowa, on the 20 of April, 1895.  his wife who was a relative of Colonel Bob Ingersoll, was born March 4, 1848 and is still living at Minneapolis, Minnesota.  The grandfather of Mrs. Bennett was related to Colonel Wallace of the English army.  Mr. Negus in early life attended the schools of Fabius, New York and was a class mate of General Slocum.  He also had an appointment to West Point, but having lost an eye through an accident on a hunting trip, he was unable to pass the entrance physical examination.  He learned the shoemakers trade.  Upon his removal from New York, he settled in Galva, Illinois, where he engaged in the hotel business, but in 1869 went to Jefferson, Iowa, and in partnership with O.J. White conducted a boot and shoe store.  He also became a land owner there.  In 1872 he located in Des Moines, where he followed his trade, being very skillful in making fine boots and shoes, but at the end of two years came to Winterset, where he remained until 1893, when he removed to Atlantic and continued to follow his trade until his death in 1895. He was also a onetime United States Marshall.  To Mr. and Mrs. Bennett have been born the following children:  Josephine, who birth occurred on the 2nd of December 1891; James Warren, born August 29, 1893 and Andrew Floyd, born December 21, 1902.

Mr. Bennett is a member of the Evening Star Lodge, No. 43, AF & AM of Winterset, and also holds membership in the Odd Fellows.  The spirit of benevolence and kindness has found expression in his daily life, he is at all times ready to assist a neighbor, and there are many in the county who are indebted to him for encouragement or material help given when they were in need.  He has worthily carried on the family tradition of public-spirited service and there is no more valued citizen in the Douglas township.","","",""

He is a native of Douglas township, this county, born April 15, 1874, of the marriage of Andrew and Mary E (Gideon) Bennett, the former born in Indiana and the latter in Ohio.  The father became a resident of Madison County, Iowa in 1852, accompanying his parents on their removal here in that year.  His father entered land in Douglas township and devoted the remainder of his life to its cultivation.  As soon as old enough Andrew Bennett began farming for himself and became the owner of land in Douglas township, which he improved and cultivated until his demise, which occurred in December, 1906, when he was seventy-one years of age.  His widow survives at the age of seventy three and resides with our subject.

George N. Bennett was reared under the parental roof and his youth was spent in much of the same manner as that of other farmer\'s sons, as he attended the district schools, assisted his father with the work of the homestead and also found time for outdoor sports.  He remained at home until he was twenty-seven years of age, farming the home place in partnership with his father.  He then rented land on his own account in Madison township and after operating it for seven years located upon a farm of 100 acres on Section 23 and 22, Madison township, belonging to his mother.  For the past six years he has operated this place, which is a valuable property, the land being fertile and everything about the farm being in excellent condition.  His work is done at the proper time and as he employs practical methods and uses up to date machinery his is rewarded with excellent crops in their season. his stock is of high grade and he finds that stock-raising is a lucrative phase of farming.

Mr. Bennett was married in October, 1896, to Miss Belle Beedle, a daughter of Abe and Rachel (Murphy) Beedle, the former a native of Indiana and the latter of Ohio.  They were among early settlers in Madison county, coming here with the respective parents, both families settling in Union township.  Mr. Beedle was reared and educated here and since coming to mature years has operated a farm in Union township.  His wife is also living.

Ed. Sentinel - Our community is shrouded in gloom, by the death of Mrs. Tyra Pratt, the wife of Geo. Pratt. Her death was caused by pneumonia, which is so prevalent of late. Mrs. Pratt was one who was loved and respected by all who knew her; one that the community will miss as a neighbor, church and Sabbath school worker, and, in fact, ever ready to lend a helping hand in time of trouble and need.

She was born Dec. 5, 1860, and died Dec. 5, 1893, her death being on her thirty-third birthday. Her maiden name was Widel and her former home was Baldwin, Iowa. Her parents died when she was quite young, leaving her in charge of a family of five brothers and sisters, who survive her. She has done a good part by always being ready to console them in time of distress. She was married to Geo. W. Pratt on Aug. 14, 1878, who survived her but was in a critical condition at the time of her death with the same disease. Five children were born to them, four of whom are left to mourn her loss, (three boys and one girl.) The services were conducted at the Nashville church, Friday inst., at 1 p.m., by Rev. Stephen Wood of Lost Nation. It was a very able and impressive sermon, speaking many words of condolence to the bereaved friends. She was laid to rest in the Buckhorn cemetery.

His natal day was the 30th of May, 1884, and he is the son of Andrew and Mary (Gideon) Bennett, who are spoken of on another page of this work.  Mr. Bennett attended public schools on North River, the school house being the second built in the township.  When twenty two years of age he assumed the management of the home farm and has since operated it.  He makes a specialty of raising purebred draft horses, but also grows the crops best suited to the soil and climate of this state.  Since he is energetic and progressive and keeps in touch with the results of investigators who are striving to make agriculture a science he is meeting with deserved success in his labors and is considered one of the leaders among the younger generations of farmers.

In 1906, Mr. Bennett was united in marriage to Miss Corgie May McDonald, who was also born in Douglas township, this county.  She is the daughter of William S and Barbara Ellen (Combs) McDonald and is the niece of the man who, when a name of the county seat was being chosen, suggested the name Winterset instead of Summerset, as the weather was cold and stormy. William S. McDonald was born in Guernsey county, Ohio, on the 23rd of May, 1848 and his wife was born near Wathena, Kansas, in 1858.  When a boy, he emigrated westward with his parents and drove a flock of 500 sheep.  The family intended to stop in Illinois, but hearing of the fine land country opened for settlement in Iowa, continued to Iowa, where they located in 1863.  William S. McDonald continued his education by attending the districts schools after his arrival in this state and upon starting out in life for himself turned his attention to agriculture pursuits.

They moved to the area from Ohio before 1849.

My grandfather, L. M. Fisher, who married to Seymore\'s sister, Mary Jane, came with them or very soon after.  He went on across the river and west and took land near where Macksburg is now.

They had to build some kind of a house and get the family settled because when the \'49ers went West in the \"gold rush,\" he went with them.  However, I never heard of any bags of gold.

My mother was born June 27, 1869.  She told me about going to Grandpa Church\'s when she was three or four years old.  They had quarried the limestone out of the ground, made it into blocks and built that good sized house and the spring house, where the water came out of the hillside and flows through a wooden trough where they set the milk, cream and butter.  This kept things cool on the hottest days.  The cool water ran through the barn lot so chickens and other animals could drink.  If my mother were living now, she would be 114 years old this June 27, 1984, and would make the old stone house at least that old.  I think the age of this unique landmark can be set between 125-130 years and doubt if there is another farmhouse in this country with a milkhouse using natural resources for cooling purposes.

John had no brothers, sisters or first cousins.  He had his first heart attack at 39 years of age.  He smoked since he was 14.  He \"quit\" after his heart attack.  he still smoked a pipe, cigars (and cigarettes, when I wasn\'t around).

John went to North River Stone School.  The stone was quarried off of the Bennettt farm.  His Dad had attended there.  His Mother had taught there, and he graduated from 8th grade the year it closed.  The next year has some questions, but he went to live with Jose and Pat Hoskins and attended Earlham High School.  he only went one semester and he quit and came home to live with his parents.  The DeSoto bus came down the road and he stared as a freshman at DeSoto High School.  That is when I met him.  Though he said he came over to the Riegle Hatchery in DeSoto and saw this girl jumping from one stack of feed in sacks to another and thought it looked fun.  She also had roller saktes and just flew around the building (I was spoiled).

John\'s folks didn\'t have much income (no one did).  He wore shirts made out of feed sacks (My dresses were of the same material).  We only had 10 in our graduating class.  Seven of them started together.  I was John\'s girl the last 2 years of high school though we didn\'t really date much.  My Dad didn\'t allow me to date.  We both played basketball and we would sit together on the bus on out of town trips.

He worked out of town some that summer and dated other girls.  I entered nursing training, an dated some one else.  He entered the army in the fall.  We decided to get married when he was home on leave in May of 1952 and did.  I went to Virginia with him.  He was sent to England and I came back to Madison County.  I lived in Grand \"Mac\'s\", Bertha and Sam Hoeness\'s basement till I could get back in nursing school.  I had Katherine March 16, 1953.  John was discharged the fall of 1954 and we lived in a trailer in Shady Rest Trailer Park on E. 14th St. in Des Moines.  We moved the trailer to my folks\' farm in Nov. of 1954.  He decided to enter Wartburg College the fall of 1956.  We took a year off in 1988 and farmed my parents\' farm.  I worked in Des Moines.  We went back to college in 1959 and on to Wartburg Seminary in 1960.  We had Dan Dec. 31, 1960 and John had problems with Greek, so we left Iowa and moved to Colorado in March of 1962.  He worked at a golf course for a few months and back to the tire business (He had been working for Firestone, when Jim was born).  We had loved Colorado though we did go to see his parents about three times a year.","","",""

He was a very rich man for those days, and was a \"Leading Friend\" of Kent Co., Delaware.  During the Revolution, he was declared a \"Tory,\" in consequence of his being opposed to the war, and from the following circumstance, he was called to account by the authorities.

Early in 1775, he wrote a letter to a friend in Philadelphia, who was indiscreet enough (without the permission of the writer), to hand it to the Editor of Humphre\'s \"Philadelphia Ledger,\" for publication.  Consequently in the 3rd Number of that Newspaper, published on Feb. 11th, 1775, appeared the following:--

\"Extract of a Letter from Kent County in Delaware.

With regard to political matters, the people have begun to change their sentiments, concluding in their more deliberate moments, that such violent measures, as have been pursued, will not heal, but on the contrary, widen the breach.  Many who have kept their sentiments to themselves, being to whisper their dislike of the proceedings gone into.  I believe the Friendly Address, and other performances of the moderate stamp, have done much good, in opening the blind eyes of many, and when people come to taste feelingly of the hardships which a suspension of trade will occasion, they will all change sides, any, I believe, if the King\'s Standard were now erected, nine out of ten would repair to it.

\"The people have not, till lately, considered the consequences of a Civil War with so brave and powerful a nation as that of Great Britain; the heat and rage of party, had not given them leisure to reflect on the devastation and havock it would occasion, and if our rashness should yet bring us on, Quere, if such reflections as these would not arise with many?  I have seen this land blest with peace and plenty, under the happiest Government in the world; every branch of business flourishing, men secured in their liberty and property, a trade open to foreign parts of the world, which occasioned a ready sale for our produce.  I have been in possession of a wife, and many children, some of whom are numbered among the slain, and others far separated; I have lived in a happy harmonious neighborhood, where the violence of party, and the appelations of Whig and Tory were unknown.  Who could think that a three penny duty on tea could occasion all these difficulties, when only a refusal to purchase the article would have kept us free?\"

Great was the excitement produced by the publication of this letter, which had not abated two months later.  In Christopher Marshall\'s diary, we find the following entry under date of:

\"April 29, 1775:  This day, about noon, Jabez Fisher came by persuasion to the Coffee House, and there declared in the presence of a great concourse of people, that it was Robert Holliday of Duck Creek, that wrote and sent that letter to him, which he has caused to be published in the Pennsylvania Ledger, No. 3, and no other person, upon which the people with some reluctancy let him go.\"

The matter was now brought under the notice of the Committee of Inspection for Kent County, in Delaware, and Christopher Marshall makes the following entry, dated:

\"May 17, 1775:  In P. Journal No. 1693, is (a) copy of Robert Holliday\'s Recantation and acknowledgment of his misconduct, the which was accepted by their Committee in Kent County.\"

The following is from the \"Pennsylvania Journal\" No. 1693,. for May 17, 1775:--

\"Extract from the proceedings of the Committee for Inspect for Kent County, on Delaware.

Dover, Tuesday, May 2, 1775. P.M.

The Committee met by adjournment, when the following Letter was laid before them, by the President of the Committee of Correspondence for said County:

\"I acknowledge to have wrote a piece (and did not sign it), since said to be an extract of a letter from Kent County, on Delaware, published in Humprey\'s Ledger, No. 3, it was not dated from any place; and is something altered from the original.  I folded it up, and directed the same to Joshua Fisher and Sons.  I had no intention to have it published, and further let them know, the author thought best it should not be published, nor did I think they would -- I am sincerely sorry I ever wrote it, as also for its being published, and hope I may be excused, for this my first breach in this way, and I intend it shall be the last.  -- Robert Holliday.\"","Vol. 1, Page 302-304","",""

After being for four years in partnership with George Kennard, the leading merchant of Smyrna, he bought out Mr. Kennard\'s interest, and started in the mercantile business for himself.  Being possessed of great natural ability, and excellent judgment, he was so successful, that in a few years he amassed a large fortune for that time and by the time he had attained middle life, he was the most extensive individual grain dealer in Delaware.  John Cummins being an excellent financier, was elected President of the Commercial Bank of Smyrna, but at the expiration of the Charter of that institution, he declined to take an interest in the Smyrna Bank, and opened a private bank, in connection with his large mercantile, milling and real estate interests, and conducted it successfully until his death.  In religion, John Cummins, like his ancestors, was Episcopalian.  He was chief founder and supporter, through life, of the Protestant Episcopal Church at Smyrna, as the memorial chancel window, of this church, donated by his youngest son, the Rev. Alexander J. Cummins, expresses.  He was a delegate, as long as he lived, to the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States.

As a gentleman of the old school, he was punctilious, and regular in his habits; in the domestic circle he was typical of the best example of the husband and father.  Besides possessing great mental strength, he was a man of indomitable will, energy and perseverance.

The following inscription is upon the tombstone of John Cummins:--

\"Active in life and tranquil in death
Behold how the Christian dies.\"

In company with his neighbor, Torger Nelsen, he made a second trip to the school and they nearly missed the building, so blinding was the storm.

Shocked by the discovery that three men were held in jail for five days before being arraigned, he stated in an opinion, \"It appears the police are permitted to flout, defy and violate the law they are sworn to uphold.\"

Asked for a ruling on Justice Vallee\'s opinion, City Atty. Arnebergh advised Chief Parker that prisoners must be arraigned within two days after being arrested, to be taken before a magistrate without delay. It also raises the question whether it\'s legal to arrest a person on \"suspicion.\"

That hollow laughter you hear is from those who weren\'t so lucky.","","",""

Jim began playing baseball when he was four years of age - and the lifelong love of the game began. From the biggest kid on his little league team (yes, biggest) to high school baseball standout and member of the renowned ?68 Eagles State Champion American Legion Team. In his early twenties he coached Little League - teaching the game to kids who are now young men coaching others. He coached Babe Ruth and then took a few years off. Eight years ago Jimmy became an integral part of the Redwood Empire Little League family. He was a coach, mentor, field crew and to some, our best friend. There is an empty coaching box that will never be filled; a mower with no one to push it; an endless list of things our friend Jimmy took care of.

Jim loved his \"kids\" and wanted only to teach them to play the game to their potential. He developed relationships with many and so enjoyed following their lives as they developed into productive young men. Jim was tireless in his work at Redwood Fields, spending nearly every Saturday doing whatever needed to be done to keep the fields in top shape. He and his special friends Rex Bohn, Dale Del Grande and Jimmy Pastori would meet every Saturday morning for breakfast and then head to the fields.
Jim attended St. Bernard?s from kindergarten through high school graduating with the Class of 1967. He received his AA degree from College of the Redwoods and then attended Humboldt State University where he majored in accounting.
Jim met his wife Jeani while golfing at Redwood Empire Golf and Country Club. They were married in 1975 in Crescent City.

Jim and Jeani owned Pacific Paper Co. and Arcata Stationers until their retirement in 2000. Jim was an avid golfer and looked forward to the Reno trips with Jim Pastori, Gary Lozensky and the rest of the guys.

Jim is survived by his loving wife, Jeani. His mother, Mary Vallée, Eureka; sisters Kathy Andersen, Pullman, W A, Mary Lou Poer (Kevin), Princeton, ID; sister-in-law Janice Briggs (Buzz), Crescent City; brothers-in-law Dick March and Harry March, Crescent City, Tom March (Carolyn), Menifee; his nephews, Dennis Andersen (Candi), Genesee, ID, Jeff Andersen, Sacramento, Matthew Briggs, Salem, OR, Kirk March, Menifee, Richard March and Harry March, Crescent City and Tom March, Santa Rosa; his niece Debby Stover (Ward), Crescent City; his great nieces Melissa, Nicole and Danielle Andersen, Genesee, ID, Autumn deSolenni (Ricardo) and Tennille Wilson (Scott), Crescent City; great-great nieces, Taylor Wilson, Jaelyn deSolenni, Sophia deSolenni, Olivia deSolenni, Crescent City, and great-great nephew Braydon Wilson, Crescent City; very special cousin, Nancy Sawyer, Eureka; Becky, Mike, Hailey and Ally Del Grande, Eureka, numerous cousins and extended family.

He was preceded in death by his father, Gabriel Vallée, brother Tim Vallée, father-in-law Lee March and mother-in-law Mable March; sister-in-law Beverlee March; grandparents Fred and Maude Papini. and Gabriel and Margaret Vallée.

Visitation will be at Sanders Funeral Home, 1835 E Street, Eureka on Sunday, January 25th from 2 to 4 p.m. A celebration of Jim?s life will be held Monday, January 26th from 2:30 to 5:30 p.m. at the Elk?s Lodge, 445 Herrick Avenue, Eureka.
In lieu of flowers the family requests that donations be made in Jim?s name to Redwood Fields, PO Box 327, Cutten, CA 95534.

His father, Robert Wilson Rasin, was in early life a farmer in Kent county, but moved to Baltimore, where he engaged in business as a real estate agent.  The family is descended from William Rasin, who settled in Kent, in 1669.  Mr. Rasin\'s mother was Mary Rebecca Ringgold Rasin.

Born in Kent county, on March 11, 1833, he was educated at Washington College, Chestertown, Maryland.  At an early age he moved with his parents to Baltimore and became a drygoods clerk.  Later he engaged in business on his own account and successfully conducted it until 1867, when he was elected Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas.  He was re-elected in 1873 by a majority of 14,000 and re-elected for the third time in 1879, thus serving 18 consecutive years in this office.

In 1886 he was appointed Naval Officer for the port of Baltimore by President Cleveland and served until 1890.  Mr. Rasin was Insurance Commissioner from 1892 until 1895, and during Mr. Cleveland\'s second administration was offered the United States Consulship in Berlin, but declined it.

He was the delegate to the National Convention that nominated Cleveland for the third time, and had always been a warm friend and admirer of the ex-President.

It is doubtful if any political leader in this country has paralleled the career of Mr. Rasin.  For nearly 40 years he had exercised a control over the Democratic Party in this city so absolute and so complete as to amount almost to a dictatorship.

His rise to power; his many battles; his methods and his personality present a story of remarkable human interest.  It can be written truthfully of him, that he lived the strenuous life and he was always on guard.

No other man in the city ever held or wielded the influence and power that were Mr. Rasin\'s.  he had made Mayors, Judges, Governors, United States Senators and Congressmen, to say nothing of scores of councilmen, members of the House of Delegates, State Senators, State\'s Attorneys, clerks of courts and other officials.

Mr. Rasin was one of the most interesting of men.  He had a way of talking that impressed what he said on his listener\'s mind, and the manner in which he said things was original.  His devotion to his family and his family\'s devotion to him were marked.  he was wrapped up in his two sons and his sons were equally devoted to him.","","",""

ESSEX - Marie S Landreth of Essex died on Feb. 13, 2007.  Known as Mies, she was a well-traveled woman who, as the wife of a distinguished CIA officer for more than 30 years, lived in Thailand, Haiti, Ivory Coast, France, Hong Kong and Holland.  She was always intensely interested in the cultures, and most importantly, in the arts each had to offer.  Indeed, her eclectic collection from around the world is a testament to her acute appreciation and refined eye of local sculpture and painting.  However, this rich life would not have been complete without the many characters she had come across during these times -- from the famous Marlon Brando (who came to a party at her house in Bangkok at the height of his career in 1953.  He loved her chicken salad!) to the infamous Raul Castro with whom she danced at the U.S. Embassy in Havana in 1959.

Miss Landreth was from the southern province of Zeeland, Holland.  her father, Jan Steketee was incarcerated by the Nazis as a member of the Dutch underground.  He propelled her to seek a life beyond the provincial borders of Holland.  She found work as a secretary on Prince Bernhard\'s staff and subsequently took a similar position in the Duth Embassy in Stockholm.  There, she met Rodney Landreth, whom she married and never looked back.  From that point, the world was her oyster.  She witnessed first-hand several coup d\'etats, including the almost weekly ritual of a new \"president for life\" of Haiti until it ended with the accession to power of Papa Doc Duvalier in 1958.  She was in Cuba when Fidel Castro took over in 1959.  She lived in Paris in 1968 when a revolution was fomented, garbage was piled high in the streets and Charles de Gaulle was unceremoniously dumped.  She was witness to power and greed, perhaps, but she was also a kind soul who befriended struggling young entrepreneurs like Jim Thompson with whom she had lunch everyday while in Bangkok in the 1950s long before his Thai silk business became an empire and his disappearance in the jungle of Malaysia became tabloid fare.

The Landreths retired to Essex in 1979, where unfortunately Rod died in 1981.  Mrs. Landreth was an active member of the Essex Yacht Club, a parishioner of St. John\'s Episcopal Church, a trustee of Essex Winter Series and a member of several local civic organizations.

Mies is survived by her two sons, Scott of Houston, Texas, and Oliver of London, England, a sister Greetje Peereboorn and a brother, Jaap Steketee, both of Holland, as well as her long-time friend, Fenton L.B. Brown.

A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m., Tuesday, Feb. 20, at St. John\'s Episcopal Church, Main Street, Essex.  Arrangements by Robinson, Wright & Weymer Funeral Home, Centerbrook.","","",""

He was among the early settlers of Hingham, having a grant of a house-lot on what is now Lincoln Street, but known in the earlier records as \"Broad Cove.\"  The two lots next to his northward were granted to William Cocram and to William Cockerill, respectively, who appear to be sons-in-law of Richard Ibrook.

Richard Ibrook came to Hingham with his wife -- whose name I have been unable to learn -- and three unmarried daughters, -- Ellen, Margaret, and Rebecca.  Ellen married Joshua Hobart, a brother of Rev. Peter Hobart, 1639; Margaret married John Tower, as above; and Rebecca married Rev. Peter Hobart.  She was his second wife.  There appear to be no means for finding the dates of the births of either Ellen or Margaret.  Rev. Nehemiah Hobart, a grandson of Rev. Peter and Rebecca (Ibrook) Hobart, has the following among his records, namely: --

\"1693, Sept. 9.  Died my Hon Grandmother, Rebecca Hobart, age 73, lived in New England 55 years.\"

This would give the date of her coming 1638, three years subsequent to the date of the grant of a house-lot to her father.","","",""

"17358","fitzvalley","I8779218640","","S16144775040","0","","","0000-00-00","Note: Work on this man was complicated by the unauthenticated story in Beers\' History of Clark County, Ohio that he had participated in the Boston Tea Party.  As I understand it, the D.A.R. steadily refused to recognize this alleged service.  Also, the S.A.R. have a marker on, or near, his grave in Vale Cemetery, supposedly in recognition of his participation in the Boston Tea Party.  Also, in the first volume/first edition of REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS BURIED IN OHIO, there is a serious error (besides his service) in the naming of his children.  The children attributed to him are the children of his son, Thomas Nawman, Jr.  Consequently, this record from Lagonda Chapter could not be used.

It was a long process to establish this line for Maye E. Meiling; and it is not known that it was finally accepted as given below.  Mrs. Meiling died 2 Jan 1953.  The record of another ancestor, Charles Kiser, Junior, was submitted for her, together with Thomas Nawman, and the Kiser record has been used in Urbana several times.

Thomas Nawman born 1749 at Lancaster Co., Pa
                          died 28 August 1821 in German Twp., Clark Co., O.
                          buried first in a family burial plot on the farm.
                          Body moved later to Vale Cemetery, where his monument may be seen.

                          Thomas Nawman, Jr. and his wife Catherine also buried there.

                         (It has been my understand that they were removed from the farm burial plot, because Elsie Belt Smeltzer, a descendant, said 
                         to me, \"We got all of our people out of there.\")

The researcher continues on, mentioning Elizabeth Huffman, Thomas\'s wife who was born in Lancaster Co. and who died 27 Jan 1833 in Champaign County, Ohio while visiting a daughter, Barbara Nawman Zimmerman and was buried in the Zimmerman family cemetery.  The text also mention\'s Thomas\'s son-in-law David Kizer, who was the the county\'s first recorder and an early surveyor (we actually own his compass and surveyor\'s chain).","","",""

"18424","fitzvalley","I8779326727","","S5352860279","0","","","0000-00-00","The birth of Andrew J. Shaffer, a well known farmer of section 7 Douglas township, occurred in Switzerland county, Indiana, on the 15th of April 1845, and his parents were Henry and Elizabeth (Myers) Shaffer. The father who was born on the 18th of February, 1800, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, removed to Indiana when conditions were those of the frontier and resided upon rented farms until 1855, when he and his family made the trip overland to Madison county, Iowa, being seven weeks on the way. They settled in Madison township eight miles from Winterset, and after living there for about a decade, removed to a farm in Douglas township which the father had purchased. Mr. Shaffer died at the home of our subject on the 12th of February, 1891. He suffered to the full extent the privations and hardships of pioneering on the desolate open prairies. His first residence in this county was but a log house with the chink holes stuffed with hay, and the severe winters occasioned much suffering, but he persevered and did his part in the development of the county. His wife was a native of the Hoosier state, born in 1814, and passed away on the 25th of September, 1868.

Andrew J. Shaffer, who is one of a family of ten children, attended the early schools in Indiana and Madison county, Iowa, which were held in log schoolhouses and which were primitive in every respect. The seats were peg stools and the desks were but six inches wide, while the curriculum embraced little beyond the three Rs. As there was a large family and as it was a struggle to make a living, our subject began to work upon his uncle\'s farm when but nine years of age, and thus partly provided for his own support. He rode one horse and drove the three others hitched to the plow, using a jerk line, and for one month\'s work received a dollar. He purchased a vest with his money and kept it for many years after he reached manhood. When a boy of twelve or thirteen years he often went with his uncle and other men to hunt deer and turkeys, and at times killed some of the game himself. While still in his teens he hauled provisions from Des Moines and Oskaloosa; he drove hogs on foot to Grinnell at a time when there was not even a railroad in Des Moines; and when seventeen years of age he hauled logs cut from timber land on what is now the Iowa state fair grounds at Des Moines. The logs, which were used to make bridge materials for the railroads that were building into Des Moines, were so heavy that five yoke of oxen were required to haul them. At that time Des Moines was only a small village and few could foresee its rapid growth and development. In 1866 Mr. Shaffer began farming for himself in this county and in 1882 he bought his present farm on section 7, Douglas township. It comprises sixty acres and is in a high state of cultivation, while all of the buildings are kept in. the best of repair. He is practical in his methods and the sale of his crops yields him a gratifying annual income.

On the 10th of March, 1868, the marriage of Mr. Shaffer and Miss Margaret Cowden was solemnized. She was born in Guernsey county, Ohio, May 6, 1848, a daughter of David and Sarah Ann (Acheson) Cowden. The father was born near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the 24th of March, 1817, and the mother on the 5th of November, 1827, in Guernsey county, Ohio. The father\'s birth occurred just twenty-four days after his parents had emigrated to this country from Scotland. When a young man he began farming in Guernsey county, Ohio, and resided there until 1857, when he and his family came overland to Madison county, Iowa. Conditions were then distinctly pioneer and there were but few settlers. A number of times the lives of his wife and daughter were endangered and there were many privations to be endured. Mr. Cowden became the owner of land in Page county in addition to his holdings in this county, which comprised one hundred acres. General farming and stock-raising claimed his time and he was highly esteemed in his community. He was an active republican and took a good citizen\'s interest in everything relating to the public welfare. He was one of the charter members and organizers of the First United Presbyterian church in Jackson township and contributed liberally to the support of that organization. He passed away on the 9th of December, 1895, but is survived by his widow, who still resides in Jackson township. To their union were born ten children, of whom the wife of our subject is the eldest. To Mr. and Mrs. Shaffer have been born four children, as follows: Effie Bell was born January 14, 1872, and died January 7, 1895. Bert Dayton, born October 29, 1875, is a farmer in Montana. He married Miss Emily White and they have two children, Ora J., and Mildred L. Clarence M. was born March 27, 1877, and died June 13, 1892. Clyde C., born March 19, 1882, is a successful young farmer of this county. He married Miss Edith Wray and their children are Hazel M. and Dorothy E.

Mr. Shaffer is loyal in his support of the democratic party, voting for its candidates and measures. He has always been active in the United Presbyterian church and contributed to the building fund of the local church of that denomination, which is situated near Pitzer, in Jackson township. He finds his greatest pleasure in the society of his family and friends, and his fine qualities of character insure him the respect of all who come in contact with him.

After the completion of his education in the country schools of his home vicinity he learned the trade of a tinner and plumber and was employed by the firm of Kreider Brothers.  The proprietors of that association were his elder brothers, and after ten years with them he started in business for himself in Wadsworth, this being twenty-two years ago, and his name is thus enrolled among the city\'s oldest business men, while his course has ever been such as to retain to him unqualified confidence and esteem as an able man and a public-spirited citizen.

Born in Guilford township of Media county, January 17, 1852, he is a son of Daniel and Martha (Bennett) Kreider, and is descended on the paternal side from Pennsylvania German stock, which was founded in Ohio many years ago by the Rev. Daniel Kreider, a minister of the gospel.  The mother was of Canadian stock and a descendant of a German and French family named Covert.  Mr. Kreider married Miss Crutilda Rodenberger, also born in Media county, where her father, Solomon Rodenberger, is a farmer.  The three children of this union are:  Herman Elbert, Zella Irene and Paul Vernon.  Mr. Kreider is a member of the Wadsworth council, and he is also a member of the fraternal orders of Odd Fellows and the Royal Arcanum and of the Lutheran church.","Volume 3, Page 1504","",""

We learn that old Mr. Cramlet, who lived seven or eight miles northeast of town was found dead last week. He had been assisted by the county for some time, but not liking to stay at the poor farm he had been living in a little hut by himself. He was in town but a short time before his death.","http://iagenweb.net/madison/obits_index/cram-crawford.htm","",""

R H Smith Holds Public Auction at Hotel in Smyrna, Del.
Special to the New York Times

WILMINGTON, Del. Sept. 24. -- The personal effects of his second wife, now dead, were sold publicly by R. Hopper Smith, widower, aged 72, formerly Sheriff of Queen Anne County, Md., in front of a hotel in Smyrna, Del., yesterday.  Smith recently married Margaret C. Bailey, a wealthy widow, aged 68, whose two sons, Frank and Daniel, attempted to have her declared insane.  Frank Baily lives at 938 Hudson Street, Hoboken, N. J.

The aged widower, who now occupies the Bailey home in Smyrna, sold among other things a box labeled \"gray shroud.\"  It had contained the garment in which his second wife was buried.

The sale attracted a crowd.  Among the household goods the framed portraits of the dead wife were conspicuous.  A woman friend of the wife became so indignant that she appropriated one of the pictures and sent it to the family.  A certificate of marriage of Smith\'s second wife to her first husband, Francis Bradbury of Elkton, Md., was put up and sold, as were also family Bibles, one containing a complete family record.  A Prayer Book given to Mrs. Bailey by her uncle, the late Rev. John A. Roche, and so inscribed, went to the highest bidder.  The shroud box was offered with a pair of blankets.

When a handsome book was returned to a relative of the dead wife it was opened at a paragraph which read: \"Honest loss is preferable to shameful gain.\"

This was written by the donor, the Rev. Mr. Roche, to his niece.","","",""

They Vainly Attempted to Have Aged Woman Declared Insane
Special to The New York Times

WILMINGTON, Del., Sept. 9 -- The town of Smyrna, Del., is agitated over an effort made by two sons of a wealthy woman to have her declared insane in order to prevent her getting married.  The attempt, which was learned today, was futile, the couple slipping away to Philadelphia and there being wedded.

The bride is Mrs. Margaret C. Bailey, aged 68, whose first husband left over $60,000, and R. Hopper Smith, aged 72, who is also rich.  It is the latter\'s third matrimonial venture.

The woman\'s sons are Frank Bailey of Hoboken, N. J., and Daniel C Bailey of Smyrna.  They opposed the match vigorously and had a Delaware lawyer engage Dr. Davies of the Delaware Sate Hospital Insane Asylum to examine their mother, but the doctor was not convinced of her insanity.

Olson, Deer Park, Sam Gilstad, Baldwin, Emma Sampson and Nelle Hovde, River Falls, many nieces and nephews in distant states, other relatives and a host of friends.

Selma took a keen, sympathetic interest in stories of pioneer days when hardships were many, when bitter tears were often shed recalling how the family was stricken with typhoid fever and lost three children, ages 19, 9, and 3 years, all buried at one time, and two months later another little girl passed away.

Selma loved music, songs and poetry. One of her favorite poems was \"O Why Should the Spirit of Martal Be Proud?\"

Her passing marks the closing of chapter of one of the most highly respected and prosperous families of the community.","","",""

\"Elder James LEMEN preached from Phil. 1:21 \"To Die is gain.\" \"Thou will show me the path of life: - In thy presence is fullness of joy; at the right hand are pleasures forever more.\" At the close he gave a short sketch of the character of the deceased.

\"The church resolved that the following tribute to his memory be recorded:

\"Brother DARROW and his wife professed religion in the autumn of 1832, and joined the Methodist Society. Being dissatisfied with that connection, and learning more fully his duty, himself and wife were baptized and united with the Bethel Church in the spring of 1833. In September, 1837, he and nearly twenty other baptist members united with the Rock Spring church. Soon after he was chosen Deacon, and December 24, was ordained to that office in this church, which he faithfully filled till his death. Our brother possessed rare and excellent qualities as a man and a Christian. He was superintendent of our Sabbath School and bible class.

\"He was conscientiously punctual in all his engagements and in all of his appointments in the Sabbath School, the prayer meeting, and the church. His religion was that of the everyday Christian. His light shown steady, and his lamp was ever trimmed and burning. He was industrious in worldly business, yet fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. During his sickness he affirmed that he should not live, set his house in order, gave directions about his funeral, and conversed with death as a familiar friend. His faith was firm, his hope bright, while a holy calmness and resignation possessed his soul amidst the last agonies of dissolving nature. The neighborhood, the church, and especially his bereaved family have sustained an irreparable loss - while to him \"To Die is gain\".


He died of a congestive, bilious fever after a severe illness of four weeks, at the age of 33 years, in full hope of a triumphant resurrection and blessed immortality.","Volume 1, Page 92-93","",""

So great indeed was his influence in local affairs that Ringgold probably had himself commissioned a justice of the county bench simultaneously with this order.

Tenderly and judiciously reared by affectionate and pious parents, her whole life was but a preparation for that quiet resting place on earth, which she loved so well, and the home prepared in heaven.  She was unaffectedly pious, a sincere graces of her disposition except to those who loved her.  She made no enemies, cherished no enmities, and was a sincere and unselfish friend.  Her character was transparently true and pure.  The perfect frankness with which she expressed her sentiments attested the candor of her disposition and the sincerity of her convictions, and was only equaled by the modest firmness with which she gave utterance to her views.  It is a blessed comfort to us, to know that she had quietly and silently, in her own closet, prepared herself to meet her God.  Months ago, while in the enjoyment of her usual health, she expressed, fully, her wishes in regard to her internment, and less than two weeks before her fatal sickness she reiterated the same wishes, and intimated that she believed she would die before the spring of the year.  Though this presentiment was fresh and full in her mind it did not deter her from nursing and watching the besides of a sick and dying relative. . There she contracted the typhoid fever, and fell, as many noble women have done before, a martyr to her affections.  She died as we would all like to die -- in the path of duty, at peace with God and man.  A star hath fallen heavenward.","63","",""

Of his early life we only know that he lived in Indiana before he came to Illinois.  He served in the Black Hawk War as a Lieutenant in Major Henry Dodge\'s battalion of United States Rangers, organized about the close of that struggle but employed in garrison and scouting duty under General Scott.  Colonel Cox became acquainted with him and learned of his ability as a surveyor in Illinois, and so secured his services for the work in the Black Hawk Purchase.","216","",""

DUTTON, who were united in marriage on June 27, 1844, by ABRAHAM LINCOLN when the great president was justice of the peace in Nauvoo, Illinois. After the ceremony was performed the happy couple had scarcely left the altar when the news came that Joseph SMITH, the famous Mormon leader, had been killed by a downtown mob, and as was frequently the case, the non-Mormon contingent, to which the newlyweds belonged, fled for safety, taking to some hiding place such belongings as were easily portable. Mrs. CURRIER treasures the photo from which the likeness herewith was reproduced, very highly, and as the venerable old couple had many relatives in this vicinity, we are glad to give space and mention to this interesting incident.","","",""

As a Times Leader Evening News and Wilkes-Barre Record carrier, I was privileged to be a student of Miss Kenworthy\'s, as she was called then.
I also knew Al Nygren, whom she later married. He was a Bear Creek Township board member whom I had great respect for and as a 7th- and 8th-grader, I was happy to see them married.

Mrs. Nygren was one of my best teachers at the then Oliver School in Bear Creek Township. When I delivered the Wilkes-Barre Record to Mrs. Nygren early each morning, she was always there on the back porch to meet me and say, \"Good morning, James, and I\'ll see you in about two hours after you get through with your route.\"

Mrs. Nygren was not only a great teacher, but also a good disciplinarian. I know that for a fact - as she would put my brother, Joe, in his place as he had a tendency to act up many times. My sister, Margaret, and I were in the seventh grade at that time and my brother was in the eighth grade.
Mrs. Nygren was very nice to me, as she knew of the Gross boys. I was a very good student and always eager to learn.

As I hitchhiked to Coughlin High School, I had her in mind when I had almost perfect attendance there for four years. I knew if I studied hard and completed Coughlin, maybe some day I could go to college and be a teacher just like her.

I knew that something had to happen financially, because my father was a coal miner with limited wages. But I kept up the hope and in a peculiar way my dream to go to college and be a teacher just like Mrs. Nygren would come true.

The opportunity came just prior to the Korean conflict. I joined the U.S. Air Force in September 1948 for four years.

After serving a tour of duty on Okinawa with the 20th Air Force, I was discharged in time to enter the University of Scranton in September 1952. Naturally, still remembering my teacher and mentor, Mrs. Nygren, I entered as an education major and graduated four years later.

I received a teaching job in Trenton, N.J., (Ewing Township public schools) and had been a teacher, counselor and an administrator for the past 49 years, retiring on June 30, 2005.

Thank you, Mrs. Nygren, for being my inspiration to go into teaching.

I am now a volunteer at the St. Lawrence Rehabilitation Center in Lawrenceville, N.J. In my new role, I help older patients to get from one part of the center to another. What a career, not ended yet.

Mrs. Nygren, your longevity spanned many years and, just for one moment, think about the thousands and thousands of children you helped along the way.

To be like you would be one of my last wishes in life.","5B","",""

"24342","fitzvalley","I5659336113","","S16144775148","999","","","0000-00-00","More than one-hundred years ago the country surrounding St. Mary?s parish was a wilderness. A greater part of the land was covered with water, and the prairies abounded with deer, wolves, and other wild animals. Sand hills, sparsely covered with rough grass gave room for Indian camps. This was the way of things when the early settlers arrived, but by the late 1800?s the scene had completely changed. The shape of the sand hills could still be seen, but the bodies of water had been drained, and the prairies were turning into a beautiful and fertile soil which under careful cultivation was beginning to give ample support for a growing population. Newly cut roads were crossing the countryside, lined for miles on miles with fences.
        
        The early settlers were concerned not only for their material welfare, but also for their spiritual well-being. It was the strength of their faith that kept their spirit alive, in what at times appeared to be a constant struggle for survival in this new country.

        Since there was no church for miles around the people gladly offered their homes for the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. But at time it was a major struggle over difficult roads and high water to get the priest from a distant railroad station by ox cart to their homes. Some of these courageous early settlers were: John Sittler, John Grose, Michael Egert, John Clementz, Morris Fritsch, George Seyller, and George Clementz. We can readily understand that these early settlers would make every effort to contribute to a collection that was taken up for a church to be erected in Geneseo.  But even then, they had to travel 14 to 17 miles in storm, hail, rain and heat ? which they did for several years ? to fulfill their Sunday obligation.","","",""

General Atkinson:
I regret to inform you that the cholera has made its appearance in the camp of the Rangers near the Wisconsin. Yesterday two privates of Capt. Browne\'s company died in a few hours after their attack, and the Captain informs me there are several men who have the premonitory symptoms of this disease. I have sent an express for Dr. Phileo, and, if it is not in his power to come to our assistance, to send Dr. Crane. Dr. McLaren is a good young man, and no doubt a good physician, but has had no experience in this terrible disease.

I wrote you by the mail yesterday fully; this letter is sent by the express who is the bearer of my letter to Dr. Phileo.

Early in August Col. Dodge closed the work of the U. S. Rangers upon the Northwestern frontier, leaving a small detachment of thirty-five men upon the ground, whose term of service had not expired, under the following order: 
Northwestern Frontier, August 7th, 1833. Second Lieutenant James Clyman,
Commanding a Detachment of U. S. Rangers:
You will remain in the neighborhood of Dodgeville with the detachment under your command; your supplies of rations will be issued by <b>Third Lieutenant John G. McDonald</b>, until the first of October, at which time you will discharge the men of your detachment, unless sooner discharged by the order of Brigadier General Atkinson. You will once in two weeks range the country from your camp near Dodgeville to the Four Lakes, where you will be able to get information as to the movements of the Winnebagoes. Should you find any of them you will treat them friendly, and take no step that could possibly involve the frontier inhabitants in difficulty with the Indians; but should you ascertain that the Winnebagoes are returning to the lands they have ceded the United States, you will without delay report the facts to General Atkinson at Jefferson Barracks, or myself, should I be stationed at that place.","75","",""

As a result, my mother, Kathleen Valley-Parker, was orphaned at age 2, and my father, Charles Parker, was also orphaned at age 2.

Arthur and Julienne both died in Buffalo, New York; Arthur died on October 8 at age 37, and Julienne died three days later on October 11 at age 30. My father\'s mother, Loretta, died in Ogdensburg on October 29 at age 34.

Arthur married Julienne on September 1, 1915, in Buffalo, NY. She had come from Buffalo to Ogdensburg to enroll in nursing school at the City Hospital, administered by the Grey Nuns of the Sacred Heart, a religious order originally founded in Montreal, Canada. Julienne?s aunt, Sister St. Stephen, was hospital administrator. Arthur was a dry goods merchant and a member of a large, well-known family.","http://www.flu.gov/pandemic/history/storybook/stories/courage/valleyparker/","",""

By the will of Richard Warfield, Sr., his son Richard, after the
marriage of his sister, Elinor, came to the homestead.
In 1723, he was one of the first organizers of the public school
system of the county. He was for many years \"one of his lordship\'s
justices.\" He was also, in the Vestry of St. Ann\'s, from 1710
to 1729. He married, about 1700, Ruth, daughter of Thomas Cruchley,
an attorney of Annapolis. Her mother was Margaret Baldwin,
daughter of John and Elizabeth Baldwin. Richard and Ruth had
one son, Alexander Warfield. Their daughter, Ruth, became Mrs.
Jos. Hall. Rachel became Mrs. Robert Davidge, and Lydia became
the wife of Dr. Samuel Stringer, and of Colonel Charles Ridgely, of Hampton. \" Warfield\'s Contrivance,\" in Howard County, adjoining
tract to \"Warfield\'s Range,\" was heired by these daughters.
Richard Warfield out-lived all his brothers and sisters, dying at an advanced age, in 1755. The Maryland Gazette, of that year, thus
records his death: \"Sunday last, died of Pleurisy, at his plantation,
about nine miles from Town, on the Patapsco road, Mr. Richard
Warfield, in the 79th year of his age, who formally was one of the
Representatives in many Assemblies of the County, and for many
years, one of our Magistrates. A gentleman of an upright and
unblemished character.\"
Alexander Warfield, his only son, inherited the homestead and
became a member of the vestry of St, Ann\'s. He had located,
during his father\'s life-time, upon \"Warfield\'s Contrivance\" and
\" Wincopin Neck,\" during which time he extended his surveys along
the Frederick turnpike from Cooksville to Lisbon. He married
Dinah Davidge, and had twelve children. They were Dr. Joshua
Warfield, of Simpsonville; Azel Warfield, near Snell\'s Bridge; Basil Warfield, the surveyor, removed to the Eastern Shore; Davidge
Warfield adjoined his brother Azel; Rezin Warfield, of \"Warfield\'s
Contrivance.\" Captain Philemon Warfield inherited the homestead
in Anne Arundel, and Colonel Charles Warfield, went to Sams Creek, now Carroll County.
Alexander Warfield\'s daughters were Mrs. Sophia Simpson, Mrs. Dinah Woodward, Mrs. Sarah Price and Mrs. Ann Marriott, after- wards Mrs. Richard Coale.
Voa These sons settled elsewhere. Captain Philemon alone remained
in Anne Arundel. He was in command of the Severn Militia Company,
which conveyed the Tories to Queen Anne County. He
married Assantha Waters, and had two daughters, Mary and Ann
86 Founders of Anne Arundel and Howard Counties.
Warfield. Mary became the wife of her cousin Lancelot Warfield,
of \"Brandy.\" Ann married Richard Dorsey, of \"Hockley.\"
The old Warfield homestead was divided between them, and,
in 1845, then known as \"The Black-Horse Tavern,\" was sold to Mr.
Gott.During the construction of the Elk Ridge and Annapolis rail- road at that time, the old building was used for the engineer corps.
It was later destroyed by fire, and now only an out building marks
the spot, at Gott\'s station. It was a long building, sixty feet in length, forty feet wide, with dormer windows.
Many descendants of Richard Warfield, will be found in the
history of Howard County.","","",""

Pontiac, Ill, Sept 9 -- Robert Fitzgerald, a well-known resident of this city and one of the pioneer farmers of the county, died at St. James hospital in this city at 3:19 this morning, death being due to gangrene.

Mr. Fitzgerald was born in Leeds, McGann County, Canada, February 14, 1839, his parents having moved to that place from Tipperary, Ireland, where they were both born. Mr. Fitzgerald was a member of a large family and when he reached the age of 17 he, in company with his brother, came to the United States. They settled first in New Hampshire. Hearing of the opportunities in the west, Mr. Fitzgerald came to Illinois about 1860, coming direct to McLean County, where he purchased land and where he made his home until his removal to this city a number of years ago.

He was entered in marriage at Lexington, Ill. April 20, 1865 to Mss Margaret Fenton, to which union there were born eleven children, one dying in infancy. Those who survive him, besides his widow, are Miss Mary Fitzgerald of Garrison, ND, Mrs. Frank Weber of Normal; Miss Margaret at home; Thomas, residing at Garrison ND; Johanna at home; William B at Garrison ND, Robert I., residing on the home place Eppards Point township; Joseph B, at home; Francis X at Garrison ND and Bartholomew at Garrison ND. Besides these he leaves a brother, Matthew, of Cooksville and a sister, Mrs. James Stokes of Chicago.

Mr. Fitzgerald was taken ill at the family home, 216 East Indiana avenue about four weeks ago with ptomaine poisoning with later developed into gangrene of the left limb. His condition grew more serious and on Thursday an operation was decided upon and he was removed to St. James hospital where an operation was performed yesterday afternoon.","","",""
